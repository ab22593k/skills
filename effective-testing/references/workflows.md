# RST Workflows and Mindset

## Testing vs. Checking
- **Testing**: A fundamentally human process of exploration, learning, and discovery. It cannot be automated.
- **Checking**: Algorithmic verification of facts. Tools perform checks; humans perform testing (which may include checking).

## Deep vs. Shallow Testing
- **Shallow Testing**: Finding the "easy" bugs (surface-level, obvious).
- **Deep Testing**: Maximizing the chance of finding "elusive" bugs (hidden, intermittent, complex).

## Session-Based Test Management (SBTM)
A method for managing exploratory testing by organizing work into uninterrupted "sessions."
- **Charter**: A clear, concise statement of the mission for the session (e.g., "Explore the checkout flow for edge-case payment methods").
- **Time-box**: Usually 60-120 minutes of focused work.
- **Notes**: Capturing what was tested, what bugs were found, and what new ideas emerged.
- **Debrief**: A short conversation with a lead/peer to review the session.

## Thread-Based Test Management (TBTM)
Organizing work around ongoing activities or "threads" of inquiry that may span multiple days, rather than fixed time-boxes.
