# Test Reporting and Storytelling

Testing is useless if you can't communicate what you've found and why it matters.

## PROOF Heuristic (Jon Bach)
Use this to ensure your testing story is complete:
- **P - Past**: What have you done?
- **R - Results**: What did you find?
- **O - Obstacles**: What got in your way?
- **O - Outlook**: What's left to do?
- **F - Feelings**: What is your professional gut feeling about the quality?

## Telescoping Reports
Provide different levels of detail depending on the audience:
- **1-Second Report**: A traffic light or "thumbs up/down" (use with caution).
- **1-Minute Report**: A brief summary of the most important risks.
- **10-Minute Report**: A summary of coverage and key bugs found.
- **1-Hour Report**: Detailed session notes and bug reports.

## Bug Significance
When reporting a bug, focus on its *significance* to the user/business:
- What is the impact?
- How likely is it to happen?
- Who does it affect?
- What are the workarounds?
