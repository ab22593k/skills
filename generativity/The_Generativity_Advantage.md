Acknowledgments
My exploration of technology generativity theory and its business applications grew
from collaborative research with Dr. Hamed Tajedin on firm-designed markets. This
intellectual journey took a decisive turn when I encountered Satish Nambisan’s sug­
gestion that entrepreneurship scholars should engage with digital technology frame­
works. His mention of Technology Generativity Theory led me to Jonathan Zittrain’s
pioneering work, which profoundly shaped my thinking.
The COVID pandemic provided an unexpected opportunity—my first sabbatical
as a university professor allowed me to immerse myself in no-code software develop­
ment, particularly on Bubble.io. This hands-on experience revealed Bubble’s ecosys­
tem as an ideal case study of generativity in practice. I’m especially grateful to PhD
student Mahdieh Sarbazvatan, whose qualitative research and interviews with Bubble
plugin developers yielded invaluable insights that enriched this book.
Many ideas presented here were refined through conference papers at the Acad­
emy of Management (AOM) and the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada
(ASAC). The thoughtful feedback from anonymous reviewers at these conferences sub­
stantially improved the work. An early podcast interview with Hunter Hastings chal­
lenged me to reframe these concepts for a broader audience, for which I remain
thankful.
My deepest gratitude goes to my family, especially my wife and intellectual sound­
ing board, Safaneh Mohaghegh Neyshabouri, and our two children, who graciously
sacrificed playtime with Dad so I could complete this project. Their patience and sup­
port sustained me throughout this journey. I also extend sincere thanks to Jaya Dalal
and the team at De Gruyter Brill for their encouragement and guidance in bringing
this book to fruition. Finally, I must acknowledge the role of generative AI in enhanc­
ing this manuscript—and the role of this manuscript in enhancing generative AI.

Introduction
On November 30, 2022 a digital product with the curious name of “ChatGPT” was re­
leased to the public by OpenAI, a company not widely known at the time. The com­
pany had been founded since 2015, bringing together an elite group of the world’s top
AI researchers with the goal of finding a safe way to achieve Artificial General Intelli­
gence (Tamkin et al., 2021), an elusive holy grail of AI research, referring to highly
autonomous AI systems that perform better than humans at most kinds of work (Mor­
ris et al., 2024). After ChatGPT was released, in a matter of days it broke records for
the fastest widespread adoption in the history of consumer software, reaching more
than 1 million users in five days and 100 million users in two months (Teubner
et al., 2023).
What makes ChatGPT’s story particularly fascinating is not just its explosive
growth but how it exemplifies a profound pattern that is the focus of this book – one
that challenges our fundamental assumptions about innovation and value creation.
OpenAI created something whose applications surprised even its own creators. As
users worldwide began sharing their ChatGPT experiences on social media, they re­
vealed uses that no one at OpenAI had anticipated. Mira Murati, then Chief Technol­
ogy Officer at OpenAI, captured this phenomenon in an interview (Lynch, 2024):
It’s one thing to statistically predict the performance of the model, it’s another thing to actually
see the capabilities when you test them across different domains and see that the models can
rhyme, they can do extremely well in biology or math tests,” she states. “That is completely dif­
ferent, when you actually bring it in the real world and see how the statistical performance
translates into actually solving hard problems.
As you will see throughout this book, product creators being surprised by their own
products is a common theme in a pattern we refer to as generativity: a system’s ability
to channel unpredicted innovations from a vast variety of contributors.
The artificial intelligence technology behind ChatGPT is not limited to the ChatGPT
user interface. In fact, even before ChatGPT was released as a consumer product, OpenAI
was selling the services of its models to developers through Application Programming In­
terfaces (APIs) which OpenAI has made incredibly easy to use. As of late 2024, around
3 million software developers around the world were building their own tools with these
models or using the services of the OpenAI models in existing software tools (Metz, 2024).
Because each developer uses a unique API key to access the AI models, API usage is
tracked by OpenAI, and the company charges a rate for each individual API call.
The nature of OpenAI’s products allow the company to profit from the innova­
tions of others on a massive scale, without having to manage or even know much
about those innovations internally, let alone make any predictions about their suc­
cess. This mechanism, which we refer to as the generativity advantage, is an incredi­
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110779639-001
2 Chapter 1 Introduction
bly powerful engine of value creation and profit that has been the key driver of suc­
cess for some of the world’s most valuable companies in the digital era. Surprisingly
however, generativity as a driver of competitive advantage has remained severely
underappreciated in discussions of business strategy and entrepreneurship. Youngjin
Yoo, a world-leading scholar of information systems, argued years ago that the “age of
generativity” is upon us and that it calls for new management practices, as well as
new theoretical models and frameworks to guide those practices (Yoo, 2013). It is time
for the world of business strategy to catch up.
This is the gap addressed by the present book. While the book is mostly geared
toward businesses that can be described as “digital platforms,” many of the argu­
ments apply to other types of businesses as well. By digital platforms, I mean digital
products that facilitate the interaction of multiple stakeholders whose contributions
can extend or increase the value of the product (de Reuver et al., 2018).
The core arguments of this book are as follows: a) the properties of generative tech­
nologies conceptualized in technology generativity theory can be viewed as inten­
tionally achievable outcomes or design choices that can be pursued with strategic intent
as features of generative products; b) the properties of dynamic markets conceptualized
in economic theories of knowledge-generating economies can be pursued with strategic
intent as design parameters or features of generative marketplaces; c) generative prod­
ucts and generative marketplaces, especially in combination with each other where
generative marketplaces form around generative products, allow firms to tap into the
generativity advantage: the mechanism of profiting from the distributed innovations of
others on a massive scale. This involves taking user-innovators seriously as profit-
generating entrepreneurs and helping them succeed and build sustainable businesses
around your platform; and d) the implementation of a strategy to intentionally pursue
a generativity advantage is not for everyone and is far from trivial: the path sometimes
requires specifically going against certain approaches that are considered “best prac­
tice” in strategy and entrepreneurship and often involves strategic trade-offs along the
way. These core arguments form the organizing logic of the chapters in this book.
Throughout the book, many anecdotes and cases are referred to that either illus­
trate examples of generative products and marketplaces, or illustrate certain product
or marketplace features that can be conducive to generativity.
The Messiness of Generativity
The generativity advantage is fundamentally different from traditional approaches to
innovation that rely on the company’s own innovative capacity or its ability to iden­
tify and acquire promising innovations from others. A generativity advantage derives
from creating the conditions for an entire ecosystem of external innovators to gener­
ate value in ways that benefit the platform owner, without requiring the owner to
anticipate or directly manage those innovations.
The Messiness of Generativity 3
The implications of this approach are profound. Traditional strategic thinking em­
phasizes control, prediction, and direct management of innovation. But the generativ­
ity advantage flips this logic on its head. It suggests that in certain contexts, the most
powerful competitive advantage comes from deliberately creating conditions for un­
planned, distributed innovation. This is not merely about “open innovation” or
“crowdsourcing” – it is about architecting systems of uncontrolled distributed value
creation, and channeling a fair amount of that value back to the platform creator.
However, this lack of control over the innovations that happen around your prod­
uct is not without its costs. Generativity is often messy and noisy, and is not always
desired. An example of a non-generative digital platform is Uber. You need it to do
something specific (get from point A to point B), and you would rather that the app
does this reliably and predictably, rather than for the app to introduce and encourage
all sorts of unpredictable innovations from its drivers. Even for a product as genera­
tive as the smartphone, a loss of control is not always an intuitive goal to pursue.
Steve Jobs was famously against allowing third-party apps on the iPhone, initially re­
sisting what has hence become Apple’s greatest money-making machine (Stier, 2024).
OpenAI has had to deal with its own share of the messiness that comes with gen­
erativity. The first method in which OpenAI opened its ecosystem to external innova­
tions was through the API. But many entrepreneurs and innovators who started build­
ing with the API were ridiculed for building simple “GPT Wrappers,” a term used in a
somewhat derogatory way to mean that these products were not adding much value
beyond what ChatGPT could do itself, and were not really sophisticated or hard-to-
build accomplishments to be proud of. Nevertheless, many entrepreneurs who per­
sisted and moved fast were able to profit handsomely from such products, although
there was and continues to be uncertainty around which applications will be replaced
by features in OpenAI’s own products and which applications will continue to provide
unique value.
By early 2025 after the release of the DeepSeek models that pointed toward a
rapid commoditization and severe cost competition at the model layer of generative
AI, it became apparent that much of the profit margin was going to be in the applica­
tion layer, where there is much more room for diverse and unique ideas. Pieter Lev­
els, the famous indie entrepreneur who profited handsomely with his PhotoAI prod­
uct at the application layer, tweeted1 in reaction to the DeepSeek developments that “I
can’t believe we all accidentally betted right on making GPT Wrappers, even though
everyone trolled us for it for years, and are now living The Good Life™.” But the story
around the messiness of masses of external innovations got even more interesting
when OpenAI opened up the ecosystem to non-developers.

4 Chapter 1 Introduction
The Saga of Laundry Buddy
In its first attempts to create a managed marketplace around its products that went
beyond APIs, on the occasion of OpenAI’s first developer day in November 2023, Sam
Altman announced the possibility to create “Custom GPTs” and make them available
to everyone (Stokel-Walker, 2023), later saying that they were looking at implementing
some sort of revenue-sharing arrangement with the creators of Custom GPTs (which
still has not materialized as of early 2025). Such marketplaces that go beyond APIs
and Software Development Kits (SDKs) are crucial milestones for gaining a generativ­
ity advantage, because they extend to a larger population of potential innovators on
your platform beyond software developers, tapping into the creativity and ideas of
the general public. If they could make this work, it would be a big win for OpenAI.
However, generativity is easier said than done. First, OpenAI failed to clearly de­
fine and offer the incentive mechanism for innovators to create custom GPTs. A
vague promise of potential revenue-sharing arrangements in the future was not
enough for most serious innovators, and they were hesitant to exert too much effort
into building custom GPTs. In fact, it turned out that this hesitancy was well founded
because months later, as of the time of writing, the revenue sharing mechanism still
seems to be a work in progress. However, this was not a complete deal-breaker and
users eventually found third-party methods to add paywall or payment mechanisms
to custom GPTs (Do Rosario, 2024). Still, it was an indication that OpenAI was not tak­
ing its non-developer user-innovators seriously as entrepreneurs.
Second, the somewhat unpredictable and fuzzy behavior of LLMs themselves cre­
ated unanticipated difficulties for innovators to be able to protect their innovations
on the platform. A key advantage of building a custom GPT was that the functionality
of ChatGPT could be extended and improved for specific use cases by giving the origi­
nal LLM additional instructions and documents that the average user may not have
or may not find it easy to give the LLM. If the platform could allow innovators to con­
ceal and protect these custom instructions and additional documents, it would allow
them to protect their intellectual property and incentivize them to participate in this
market. However, soon users learned that it was relatively easy to trick or manipulate
a custom GPT to reveal its instructions and even provide its custom documents for
download. This issue again created an incentive problem preventing innovators from
considering custom GPTs as a serious profit opportunity. OpenAI could potentially ad­
dress this problem by, for example, adding a protector agent in the workflow of users
interacting with custom GPT that would check if the custom GPT was about to reveal
too much, and prevent it from doing so. The company already has such mechanisms
to prevent ChatGPT from re-producing large pieces of copyrighted text. But unfortu­
nately, as of the time of writing, the company has not made a similar effort to protect
the intellectual property of custom GPT creators.
A clue as to why the custom GPT marketplace has received such little love from
OpenAI developers may be found in the now infamous saga of Laundry Buddy. Laun
The Saga of Laundry Buddy 5
dry Buddy was the name of one of the examples of a custom GPT that was displayed
in Altman’s developer day presentation. It was a custom version of ChatGPT in­
structed to focus on laundry care advice. After Altman’s presentation, Laundry Buddy
became a point of controversy, ridicule, and expressions of disappointment among
some of the users and developers of the OpenAI ecosystem.
The concept of Laundry Buddy quickly became fodder for jokes and memes
across social media platforms. Someone on the OpenAI community forum wrote that
“These are just placeholder apps (GPTs) to fill space. Obviously nobody needs a “laun­
dry buddy” GPT.”2 Many viewed Laundry Buddy as a symbol of underwhelming inno­
vation and a loss of direction, especially given the high expectations surrounding arti­
ficial general intelligence (AGI). This sentiment was captured in a popular quote: “We
were promised AGI and got laundry buddy.” For example, Jeremy Howard, a promi­
nent figure in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, posted this
tweet about the announcement of custom GPTs3 (see Figure 1.1):
I could barely watch the keynote. It was just another bland corp-speak bunch of product updates.
For those researchers I know that were involved from the beginning, this must have felt nausea-
inducing. The plan was AGI, lifting society to a new level. We got Laundry Buddy.
The Laundry Buddy saga demonstrates that pursuing a generativity strategy is not
easy, and not always well understood or appreciated. While at first glance it may
seem “beneath” a team of the world’s greatest AI researchers earning exorbitant sala­
ries to produce Laundry Buddy, the point of custom GPTs like this was exactly that
anyone, anywhere, especially those outside of OpenAI, and especially non-developers,
could now build and innovate with ChatGPT, and they could build things as seemingly
distant from the work of OpenAI as a laundry assistant. We are already used to this in
other contexts of more established generative marketplaces. For example, a simple
game app like Flappy Bird that was made in just 2–3 days by a lone developer could
be considered as not up to par with the standards of world-leading software engineers
who work at Apple Inc., but everybody is comfortable with the fact that the entire
point of the App Store is to allow for innovations from people who do not work for
Apple (Keyhani, 2023).
The Laundry Buddy controversy illuminates a crucial paradox at the heart of gen­
erativity strategies. Those who dismissed it as trivial missed its profound strategic sig­
nificance. In the digital economy, true power often comes not from creating the most
sophisticated applications but from enabling others to create applications of any so­
phistication level, even applications that seem mundane, boring, useless, or not up to
par with the grand vision or standards of a leading edge company. This principle—
that generativity is messy and that is what makes it powerful—has driven the success

of platforms from the Apple App Store to WordPress, where simple innovations like
Flappy Bird can coexist with sophisticated enterprise software. The story of Laundry
Buddy suggests that this idea is not something to be taken for granted.
OpenAI continues to struggle with the messiness of generativity. On January 14,
2025 the company announced a new “Tasks” feature for ChatGPT, and users found
many of the use cases to be unsophisticated, once again attracting widespread mock­
ery. For example, one user wrote in mocking tone “this is chatgpts [sic] true purpose”4
in a tweet with a screenshot of ChatGPT sending a reminder to check the oven in 5
minutes. Another user wrote “so nothing actually useful. But im [sic] sure wall street

Generativity in Computer Science 7
[sic] loves this.”5 But one user wrote an appropriate response to this tweet, which cap­
tures the point I am trying to make here: if seeing some mundane use cases for a new
generative feature makes you dismiss the product as useless, “you must have zero
imagination.”6
Generativity in Computer Science
The launch of ChatGPT marks an early milestone in the generative artificial intelli­
gence (AI) revolution, which is set to bring advances even greater than previous in­
dustrial revolutions (Dohmke et al., 2023; Eloundou et al., 2023; Zarifhonarvar, 2024).
The “generativity” that is the topic of this book is mostly unrelated to the “generativ­
ity” of generative AI in the computer science sense of the word. But it just so happens
that generative AI is also an incredibly generative technology in the technology theory
sense of the word that is the topic of this book, making ChatGPT a perfect case study.
It may help to clarify the different notions of generativity before we move on.
ChatGPT is based on a technological breakthrough in machine learning, using
neural networks to build Large Language Models (LLMs), which essentially learn pat­
terns from everything humans have ever written, to generate new writing on demand
based on user queries (Minaee et al., 2024).
The “GPT” in ChatGPT alludes to the particular architecture of the neural network
and machine learning setup that was able to achieve a performance leap in Large
Language Models, making them so intelligent that they rendered the famous Turing
Test7 irrelevant almost overnight (Tikhonov & Yamshchikov, 2023). The acronym GPT
stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer. A transformer in machine learning is
a specialized neural network architecture designed to process sequential data, partic­
ularly excelling at understanding the relationships between elements in a sequence
like words in a text. Unlike previous approaches that processed sequences linearly,
transformers can attend to all elements simultaneously through a mechanism called
“self-attention,” allowing them to identify complex patterns and dependencies regard­
less of how far apart elements appear in the sequence (Vaswani et al., 2017). The “pre-
trained” component indicates that the model undergoes an initial training phase on
vast amounts of data before being fine-tuned for specific applications. This pre-
training allows the model to develop a broad understanding of patterns in language

� The Turing Test is a protocol suggested by Alan Turing (1950) to test the level of intelligence
achieved by a computer. The test evaluates artificial intelligence by having a human judge engage in
separate text conversations with both a computer and another human, without knowing which is
which. If the judge cannot reliably identify which conversation partner is the machine based on their
responses, the computer is considered to have passed the test.
8 Chapter 1 Introduction
or other sequential data that can then be applied to particular tasks. The “generative”
aspect refers to the model’s ability to generate new sequences by predicting what ele­
ments should come next given a starting point.
Before generative AI, prediction was the main task that AI was used for. But if
you just put together the next prediction with the next prediction with the next pre­
diction and so on, you can effectively generate new content. For Large Language Mod­
els, these predicted elements are small strings of text called “tokens,” not exactly
words, but you could think of the process as guessing the next word in a sentence,
and the next word, and the next word, until you have a meaningful piece of writing
(Ouyang et al., 2022).
More generally, in the context of AI, the words “generative” or “generativity” typi­
cally refer to the ability of a system to create new content – whether text, images,
code, or other media – that resembles human-created work. This AI-based generation
happens through statistical pattern recognition on a massive scale, where the system
learns to predict likely sequences of words, pixels, or code based on the patterns it
has observed in its training data. LLMs and diffusion models (for images and video)
and other forms of generative artificial intelligence have turned “Generative AI” into
ubiquitous terminology.
The Other Generativities
Generativity is a concept that is used in different ways in other contexts. The term
“generativity” carries distinct meanings across various disciplines, each enriching our
understanding of creation and contribution.
In the domain of psychology, Erik Erikson introduced “generativity” in his theory
of psychosocial development (Erikson, 1963), defining it as the concern for establishing
and guiding the next generation. In another usage of the term, psychologist Robert Ep­
stein’s Generativity Theory (Epstein, 1999) offers a framework for understanding how
novel ideas and behaviors emerge. It posits that creativity results from the interaction
of established behavioral repertoires, leading to new combinations and innovations. In
linguistics, “generativity” refers to the capacity of grammar to produce an infinite num­
ber of sentences from a finite set of rules (Chomsky, 1961). This concept, central to
Noam Chomsky’s theory of generative grammar, highlights the innate human ability to
generate and understand novel sentences, reflecting the creative aspect of language
use. But these meanings of generativity are not the focus of this book.
Generativity, in the context of technology theory, represents the capacity of sys­
tems to drive unanticipated innovation through the contributions of broad, varied,
and often uncoordinated audiences. This notion, prominently articulated by Jonathan
Zittrain (2006, 2008), describes the ability of a system to empower and incentivize
others—be they users, developers, or other external actors—to innovate and contrib­
ute back to it in ways that are valuable, and sometimes unexpectedly so. This inter
Outline of this Book 9
play fosters an environment where innovation flourishes, often arising from surpris­
ing directions and producing outcomes that were neither predicted nor controlled by
the original creators. When leveraged strategically, this sense of generativity creates
exponential value by harnessing the distributed creativity of millions of minds, each
building upon and extending the work of others in ways that would be impossible to
centrally coordinate or predict. This is the meaning of generativity that is the focus of
this book.
Outline of this Book
The premise of The Generativity Advantage centers on the transformative power of
generativity as a core driver of competitive advantage in the digital era. Chapter 2
summarizes the core arguments of the book and introduces the case of Bubble.io, a
no-code software development platform that I have both used and studied exten­
sively, and frequently use for illustrative purposes throughout the text. Chapter 3 pro­
vides a deep dive into the concept of generativity, as formulated by Zittrain and aug­
mented in this book (by adding a profitability dimension). The chapter also reviews
some more recent developments in the generativity literature, although this content
is not a pre-requisite for the remainder of the book. Chapter 4 applies generativity
theory to the unit of “product” and focuses on the notion of a generative product. The
chapter provides suggestions on how to go about designing products to be inten­
tionally generative. Chapter 5 explores some ways in which managing a generative
product could involve deviations from common practices in product management.
Chapter 6 applies the notion of generativity to the unit of “market” although here
it is not so much generativity theory we are building on as it is theories from the eco­
nomics literature on dynamic innovation-generating economies. Chapter 7 builds on
the premise that many digital platforms have enough flexibility and control over their
marketplaces to intentionally design them for optimal generativity. The chapter sug­
gests a three-layered architecture for generative markets, and dives deep into the at­
tributes of each layer: allocation, generation, and appropriation.
Chapter 8 explores the idea of putting product generativity and market generativ­
ity together and benefiting from the synergies therein. Chapter 9 provides a review of
some of the challenges involved in implementing a generativity advantage in practice.
Specifically, a number of tensions or trade-offs are considered that organizations are
likely to face when pursuing a generativity advantage. Chapter 10 concludes the book
by reflecting on generativity as an approach to business that is based on the timeless
idea of empowering others to innovate, and more broadly as a celebration of the
shared potential of humanity.
Chapter 2
The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
As discussed in the previous chapter, the idea of “generativity” has been defined by
Harvard law scholar Jonathan Zittrain as “a system’s capacity to produce unantici­
pated change through unfiltered contributions from broad and varied audiences” (Zit­
train, 2008, p. 70).1 An alternative way to describe generativity is a mechanism that
allows for a massive increase of participation into the value creation process and al­
lows for the conversion of this participation into a massive increase of innovation.
This key mechanism has been recognized as one of the most consequential affordan­
ces of digital technology (Yoo, 2013). However, it has remained largely under-
appreciated from a business perspective as a source of competitive advantage. Despite
some suggestions (Nambisan, 2017), none of the major theories of strategic manage­
ment and competitive advantage such as the resource-based view (Barney, 2001) or
the theory of dynamic capabilities (Teece et al., 1997) covers the generativity mecha­
nism in any useful manner. This is quite a glaring omission as the generativity pattern
can be found at the heart of the business models that produced many of the major
giants of the digital era, including Alphabet (Google), Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Face­
book, and Alibaba. In this chapter we explicitly conceptualize generativity as a source
of strategic and competitive advantage, and provide a summary of the arguments that
will be elaborated on in the remainder of the book. The next chapter goes deeper into
the generativity concept itself.
A Definition of the Generativity Advantage
The generativity mechanism of competitive advantage can be defined in simple terms
as the mechanism of profiting from the unpredicted innovations of others on a mas­
sive scale. It is helpful to break down this definition word by word (see Figure 2.1).
Others, not yours. No matter how many and how smart your employees are, most
of the best ideas will come from outside your company. This has been pointed out by
open innovation researchers for years (Chesbrough, 2006). The trick is in the tools
and incentives, or how to enable and motivate masses of people outside your organi­
zation to innovate in ways that benefit your organization and allow you to share in
the fruits of their innovations. For example, Apple and Google benefit—and take a
revenue cut—from many innovative mobile apps on their app stores, developed by
people around the world who do not work for these companies. If these companies
were to hire ten times the number of employees they currently have and put together

A Definition of the Generativity Advantage 11
all their brain power, they still could not possibly conceive of the number and range
of innovative apps available now or in the future on their app stores. Even if Apple
hired every top software developer in Silicon Valley, they still couldn’t match the cre­
ative output of millions of developers worldwide working on countless different prob­
lems and opportunities. The power lies not just in numbers but in diversity of knowl­
edge, perspective and motivation.
Innovations, not just ideas. Ideas are a dime a dozen, and not all of them prove to
be valuable. To profit from generativity there must be mechanisms in place to not
only attract a large number of ideas and experiments but also help turn participant
ideas into value-creating innovations. For example, Google and Apple both provide
extensive application programming interfaces (APIs), software development kits
(SDKs), and documentation to help people learn how to build apps for their platforms.
Google provides various toolkits such as Firebase, Google App Engine, Android Studio,
as well as various APIs to other Google services such as Google Gemini, Google Maps,
and Google Cloud Machine Learning to help developers build apps. As a result, nu­
merous apps are released every day. However, the population of developers who can
use APIs and SKDs is still a limited group compared to the general public. A common
way in which organizations fail to take full advantage of generativity is to limit partic­
ipation to developers and software companies. While this can be seen as a form of
filtering or quality control, the most generative platforms are the ones that truly em­
power the everyday innovator and tap into the distributed ideas among the general
public. Third party no-code tools like Flutter, Adalo, and others allow non-developers
to build on top of the Google ecosystem and for the Android marketplace, these tools
expand the population of innovators. As of the time of this writing, every single day
more than 1200 apps are released on each of these app stores, and about 2 million
apps are available for download on both platforms.2
The word “unpredicted” is perhaps the most counterintuitive yet most crucial as­
pect of generativity advantage. Traditional strategic thinking emphasizes prediction
and control. But what if the greatest opportunities are precisely those you couldn’t
have predicted? The emphasis on unpredictability highlights the relatively undirected
nature of knowledge search enabled by generative systems (Tajedin et al., 2019). Gen­
erativity is a mechanism to unchain knowledge search from the limitations of the
searcher. This unchaining frees the search process not only from the organizational
capacity and cognitive capacity limits of the searcher but also from their prejudices,
biases, and blind spots (a.k.a. “unknown unknowns”). Generative competitive advan­
tage arises from mechanisms that result in the organization benefiting from future
innovations it cannot and need not predict or conceive of on its own. It is not neces­
sarily the case that all such innovations are unpredictable, although many may be.
The point is to remove the need to predict them as a condition to benefit from them.

12 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
For example, when the low production quality mobile game “Flappy Bird” became a
sensation, making tens of thousands of dollars of daily revenue in 2014, Apple and
Google took a large cut of this revenue without having had to conceive of this idea or
predict whether or not it would work. If their employees had been forced to predict,
they would reasonably have predicted that the app would be a failure due to its low
production quality (it was developed by a lone developer in the course of 2–3 days).
The game’s crude graphics and simple mechanics seemed to violate every principle of
good game design. Yet it captured something in the zeitgeist that no focus group or
market analysis could have revealed.
An emphasis on massive scale refers to the capability of digital technologies to
automate processes and distribute information at zero or close-to-zero marginal costs
of production (Shapiro & Varian, 1999). Leveraging these technologies through their
products, organizations can effectively engage in practically unlimited interactions
with unlimited people in parallel without being bound by human and organizational
capacities. The massive scale of engagement allows organizations to tap into the activ­
ity that goes on in a large network of uses, with the creation of ideas, contributions,
and innovations of others building on each other and enabling even more ideas, con­
tributions, and innovations. Once “Flappy Bird” was released, it was virtually costless
for Apple and Google to instantly distribute the app to countless number of people,
and to allow any number of people to download and pay for the app instantly at any
time. It also came at no significant cost to Apple or Google for Flappy Bird’s creator to
learn and get ideas from other mobile games in order to come up with this idea, and
for countless later games to learn and get ideas from Flappy Bird and its game me­
chanics.
Lastly, the word “profiting” emphasizes the need to find ways to channel innova­
tions into a path that ultimately benefits the organization. While the generativity
mechanism may drive innovation and value creation on a massive scale, it does not
necessarily turn into a driver of competitive advantage for any particular firm if that
firm does not have any method of systematically profiting from those innovations.
For example, no one company3 has been able to substantially appropriate value from
the immense generativity created around the WordPress content management sys­
tem, estimated to be used by 43% of all websites on the internet.4 However, Apple and
Google take substantial cuts from all the revenue generated through their app stores.
Other examples of success in both value creation and value capture from generativity
include the game platforms Minecraft (Mojang Studios) and Roblox.
Another key element of profitability in the generativity advantage is that in order
for you (the platform owner) to profit, your user-innovators must profit. To do that,
� Except maybe Google (which was not the creator of WordPress) because so many of those websites
find their audience through Google Search and monetize through Google Ads.

you must take your user-innovators seriously as profit-generating entrepreneurs. This
is why I advocate for a profit-driven approach to generativity in this book. The most
powerful way to drive sustained innovation is to enable users to build viable busi­
nesses and careers around the platform, turning occasional contributions into long-
term commitment. By enabling users to capture value, the product harnesses a power­
ful incentive, driving the scale and sophistication of innovation in ways that other in­
centives cannot.
Yet another important aspect of profitability in generative advantage is to avoid
bearing significant costs resulting from failed experiments and unproductive or
value-destroying ideas. For example, if a mobile app is costly to build but ends up
being a flop, making no revenue once released, Apple or Google do not incur any sub­
stantial costs for this failed experimentation. These companies benefit from all the
successes and incur virtually no cost from the failures. This is an underappreciated
benefit of relinquishing direct control over innovation.
Figure 2.1: The Components of Generativity Advantage.
There are two powerful devices through which firms can pursue and gain a generativ­
ity advantage: through products and through markets. It is also possible, and im­
mensely potent, to benefit from a generativity advantage through both products and
markets, a phenomenon I refer to as the “generativity flywheel.” I describe each of
these below.
14 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
Product Generativity
Zittrain (2008) offers five key characteristics of a generative system or technology. In
simplified terms, these are: leverage (the number of things it can do), adaptability
(how easily it can be modified to do new things), ease of mastery (how easy it is to
learn and build on it), accessibility (how easily it is to access and use it), and transfer­
ability (how easy it is for innovations to be shared and build on each other). In this
book we add a sixth element: profitability (how easy it is to profit from innovations
with it). See the next chapter for a more detailed discussion.
Consider how these characteristics played out in the evolution of the smartphone.
When the iPhone was first released, who could have predicted it would become a plat­
form for everything from mental health therapy to autonomous drone control? Its
generativity emerged from the combination of these six elements – powerful capabili­
ties, endless adaptability, relative ease of use, broad accessibility, the ability for inno­
vations to build upon each other, and the ability of innovators to profit from their
innovations.
Generative products are more like general-purpose toolkits that could be put to
many uses rather than narrow-scope products that accomplish a limited number of
tasks. It is often hard to describe to people exactly what they do, and even if the prod­
uct creator tried to describe it in exact terms, they would likely be doing the product
a disservice by limiting its description to the bounds of their own imagination. For
example, SparkFun Electronics is a company that offers products around very genera­
tive platforms like the Raspberry Pi which are very generative hardware products.
The company has made a deliberate decision not to label its products as having spe­
cific uses, because of instances where customers were able to find uses for their prod­
ucts that they had not imagined (Murphy, 2014).
The ambiguity around generative products presents a fascinating paradox in
business strategy and entrepreneurship. Almost all established approaches to strate­
gic planning and business planning emphasize the need for clear value propositions
and defined use cases. Think of popular tools and frameworks like the Value Proposi­
tion Canvas (Osterwalder et al., 2015) or the notion of an “elevator pitch.” Yet for gen­
erative products, this clarity can be counterproductive. When personal computer
products were first released, their creators faced a dilemma: how do you market a
tool whose most valuable uses haven’t been invented yet? It was hard to describe to
people exactly what they’re good for until certain “killer apps” were found that dem­
onstrated their practical value to most users (Zynda, 2013). One of those killer apps
was spreadsheet software (e.g., VisiCalc), which is itself a highly generative product.
It often takes a long time for generative products to really take off. Building and
managing generative products is tricky, as some of the existing “best practices” in en­
trepreneurship and product management do not assume generativity by default. Prof­
iting from generative products requires an extraordinary amount of patience, as time
Market Generativity 15
is required to allow large numbers of users to “play” with a product and learn what
they can do with it that is valuable to them.
The ambiguity tolerance and patience requirements of generativity make certain
environments hostile to generative products. The more a system requires you to have
to convince others before you build something (such as academic peer reviewers,
granting agencies, investors, incubators, funding bodies, etc.), and the more a system
rewards short-term results instead of long-term plays, the less nourishing it will be
for generativity. The more you have to be specific about exactly what problem you
are solving (instead of being given the flexibility to solve classes of problems at a
meta level), and the more you are forced to provide specific plans and timelines, the
farther you are getting from an environment that nurtures generativity. For these rea­
sons, managing for generativity often requires practices that may run counter to com­
monly recognized best practices.
Not all products should be designed for generativity, and generativity is not al­
ways desirable. But when it works well it can be an extremely powerful mechanism
because it essentially embeds knowledge search and opportunity discovery into the
product itself, so that these processes are no longer limited by the existing employees
or organizational capacity of the company, and no longer constrained by the pre-
existing knowledge, biases, and blind spots of those employees. Because the product
itself encourages and enables play and innovation, the burden of engendering these
innovations is largely lifted from the shoulders of the organization.
Importantly, generativity is, to a large extent, a feature of the technology itself,
not just a way to manage or organize around digital technologies. In other words, it is
a way to get the technology to do some of the hard work of organization for you. This
autonomous aspect of generativity unleashes an incredible level of scalability which
is perhaps the key reason behind the success of today’s digital behemoths. However,
this does not mean that organizational techniques cannot be leveraged to enhance the
generativity advantage.
The range of opportunities that the firm can benefit from through product gener­
ativity is much larger than those that could be discovered through direct search by
the firm itself. However, the search range afforded by product generativity is still
bounded by the features of the product. No product, even a highly generative one like
the mobile phone or spreadsheet software, can be put to unlimited uses.
Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of this book provide a deeper dive into the characteristics of
generativity and how to design and manage products for generativity.
Market Generativity
Markets are essentially knowledge-generating mechanisms that enable and incentiv­
ize distributed innovations without any coordination or prediction required by a cen­
tral organizer. It has taken a long time for economists to truly appreciate this knowl
16 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
edge-generating and innovation-producing feature of markets (Warsh, 2006) and un­
fortunaltey the traditional view of markets as purely resource allocation mechanisms
(Backhouse & Medema, 2009) still looms large.
Granted, some markets should be focused on resource allocation only, and we do
not need the noisiness of generativity and unpredicted innovation in them. These in­
clude for example various “matching” markets such as the matching of interns to hospi­
tals, organ donors to recipients,5 and drivers to riders (e.g., Uber). In such markets, we
often prefer efficiency, predictability, and reliability over new knowledge and innova­
tion. But most general-purpose markets and economies are powerful and noisy engines
of innovation, and this has been the main source of advancement in our societal well-
being and prosperity over the course of history (Phelps, 2013; Phelps et al., 2020).
The beauty of market generativity lies in its ability to harness what Friedrich
Hayek (1945, p. 521) called “the knowledge of particular circumstances of time and
place” – the scattered bits of insight and opportunity that no central planner could
ever fully grasp. When Apple created the App Store, they didn’t need to predict that
ride-sharing would revolutionize transportation or that mobile gaming would become
a multi-billion dollar industry. They simply needed to create conditions where entre­
preneurs could discover and exploit such opportunities, while ensuring they captured
a share of the value created. A firm that enjoys market generativity does not have to
know or predict much about the specifics of the problems on the demand side or the
solutions on the supply side, other than the general domain knowledge necessary to
engage with that market as a business model. For example, Amazon may have some
general knowledge about the business of books but does not need to know exactly
what content needs to be written in a book for it to sell. For a more detailed discus­
sion of the benefits of markets as a mechanism that can be strategically deployed, see
Chapter 6.
Firms can gain a market generativity advantage by tapping into the generativity
of markets they design and govern themselves (a.k.a. “firm-designed markets”), tap­
ping into the generativity of markets managed by others, or tapping into the genera­
tivity of the entire economy. Essentially, market generativity advantage involves fig­
uring out ways to “tax” or otherwise profit from the distributed and unpredicted
innovations that occur in a market on a massive scale. This advantage is greater if the
firm can effectively enable and incentivize these innovations, especially those it can
profit the most from. While generativity is often driven by curiosity and play, the no­
tion of market generativity emphasizes profit incentives that are known to be a pow­
erful mechanism of distributed coordination.
� These allocative markets are the types of markets frequently studied in the market design branch
of economics, and the subject of study for multiple winners of the Nobel prize in economics (Rochet &
Tirole, 2003; Roth, 2008).
Product-Market Generativity 17
As I have written elsewhere, my definition of successful entrepreneurship is the
creation of self-sustaining value-creating systems (Keyhani, 2023) where value crea­
tion refers simply to achieving more preferred states for all affected stakeholders. To
successfully launch and operate a generative marketplace we need to make sure that
it is both value-generating and self-sustaining, and that its user-entrepreneurs are
also empowered to create self-sustaining value-creating systems around their innova­
tions on the platform.
Firms like Apple and Google profit from app marketplaces that they themselves
design and govern. These marketplaces are complements to—and dependent on–spe­
cific products owned or controlled by the two companies, such that the products
(apps) bought and sold on these marketplaces only have value in relation to the prod­
ucts owned and controlled by Apple and Google. Therefore the success of user-
entrepreneurs and the platforms are interlinked.
In designing a marketplace, aiming specifically for generativity can be a con­
scious strategic decision. These design choices and decisions are covered extensively
in Chapter 7. The default mental model of what a market is and does is that of re­
source allocation and matching, so it takes deliberate mental effort to think in terms
of market generativity. As noted above, optimizing for innovation and knowledge gen­
eration may involve trade-offs with allocative efficiency and reliability. Some imple­
mentation challenges of generativity are discussed in terms of trade-offs in Chapter 9.
Product-Market Generativity
One of the key arguments in this book is that generative products are most powerful
in combination with generative markets. Instead of concepts like community, ecosys­
tem, or crowds, I emphasize markets specifically because of the high-powered incen­
tives. Market incentives prove uniquely powerful in driving sustained, sophisticated
innovation. When people can build viable businesses and careers around a generative
platform, they invest in ways that transcend occasional contribution. If you have only
one takeaway from this book let it be this: if you have a generative product, take your
users seriously as innovators who can generate profit, and empower them as entre­
preneurs. Go beyond the idea of looking at user-innovators as novelties or interesting
phenomena that illustrate how surprisingly valuable your product is. Acknowledge
that in fact the most important sources of value from your product may be discovered
by those users and that they deserve to profit from such discoveries.
The mapping of market generativity on product generativity creates four distinct
patterns:

1. Traditional Products and Markets (Low Product, Low Market Generativity): Com­
   panies like Uber and Netflix that focus on efficient matching and delivery rather
   than enabling external innovation
   18 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
2. Generative Products Without Markets (High Product, Low Market Generativity):
   Platforms like early Notion or Raspberry Pi that enable extensive user customiza­
   tion but initially lack formal marketplaces for sharing innovations
3. Innovation Marketplaces (Low Product, High Market Generativity): Platforms like
   Etsy that create vibrant markets for innovation without particularly generative
   core products
4. Full Generative Systems (High Product, High Market Generativity): Platforms like
   mobile app marketplaces or Roblox that combine generative products with robust
   markets for innovation
   Many successful platforms begin with highly generative products and later evolve to
   build marketplaces around them—a natural progression as user innovations create
   opportunities for formal exchange. The relationship between generative products and
   marketplaces is almost magnetic—generative products naturally attract and almost
   demand the formation of marketplaces around them. This is no coincidence. The very
   features that make a product generative—its adaptability, extensibility, and capacity
   to enable diverse innovations—create perfect conditions for marketplace formation.
   When users can create novel solutions with a product, they inevitably want to share
   and monetize these innovations.
   This natural affinity helps explain why so many successful generative products
   eventually evolve to incorporate formal marketplaces, and why OpenAI wanted to
   create the market for custom GPTs. The marketplace is the logical completion of the
   product’s generative potential. If the product creator doesn’t establish an official mar­
   ketplace, unofficial ones often emerge organically to fill this vacuum. Consider how
   users of Microsoft Excel, in the absence of an official template marketplace, have
   turned to platforms like Etsy and Gumroad to sell their spreadsheet innovations. The
   generative potential of Excel created such a strong pull toward market formation that
   users found alternative channels when no official marketplace existed. Similarly, be­
   fore Notion created a template marketplace on its own website, users were already
   buying and selling templates outside of the platform, and informal marketplaces like
   Notionery.com had launched to organize these transactions. Consider this conversa­
   tion between Ivan Zhao (founder of Notion) and Natsuki Zihnioglu (DNX Ventures)
   showing their interest in this phenomenon (Zihnioglu & Zhao, 2020):
   Natsuki: So there are these Notion “pro” people, consultants who are not Notion employees, but
   independently creating a bunch of templates and selling them and stuff. They are all quite crea­
   tive, and so helpful for those who find it difficult to create something from scratch. Just like you
   envisioned, it’s getting even easier to create a new way of workflow.
   Ivan: Indeed, now the community of users is taking the “Lego” pieces to places that you never
   imagined, right? So there’s the Lego convention, where plenty of enthusiasts showcase their crea­
   tions. So it is with Notion users. They share their template, work setups on Reddit, on Twitter,
   The Generativity Flywheel 19
   and some people are selling them and making a great business for themselves. Maybe I should
   quit my job, and start selling Notion templates (laughs).
   This magnetic attraction between generative products and marketplaces points to a
   crucial strategic insight: companies with highly generative products will do better to
   proactively build and manage marketplaces rather than leaving this natural evolution
   to chance. Chapter 8 provides a more detailed discussion of product-market generativ­
   ity and the idea of the generativity flywheel, which we discuss next.
   The Generativity Flywheel
   The synergy between product and market generativity creates what we might call a
   “generativity flywheel.” A generative product attracts innovative users who create
   novel applications. These applications make the product more valuable, attracting
   more users and developers. Meanwhile, the marketplace surrounding the product en­
   ables value capture and provides incentives for continued innovation. The innova­
   tions not only increase the value of the product but open entire new possibilities for
   further innovations. This virtuous cycle explains why companies that master both
   forms of generativity – like Apple and Google, and even Amazon – have become some
   of the most valuable enterprises in history.
   Consider how this dynamic unfolded in Apple’s ecosystem. The iPhone’s product
   generativity – its capacity to be reprogrammed and extended through applications –
   attracted developers eager to experiment with its capabilities. Early innovative appli­
   cations like Instagram and Uber demonstrated novel uses of the device’s cameras and
   location services, expanding people’s understanding of what a smartphone could do.
   This attracted more developers who now had new ideas for apps based on the new­
   found examples. These innovations in turn attracted more users to the platform, in­
   creasing the potential market for developers’ applications.
   Simultaneously, the App Store’s market generativity provided clear pathways for
   value capture, ensuring that successful innovations could be monetized. This eco­
   nomic incentive drew more developers, who brought diverse expertise from fields
   Apple had never considered – from medical imaging to autonomous navigation. Each
   new application potentially opened up new use cases, attracting specialized user seg­
   ments who might not have otherwise seen value in a smartphone.
   The flywheel gains additional momentum through spillover effects – where one
   successful application inspires related but distinct innovations. When Uber succeeded
   with ride-sharing, it sparked innovations in food delivery, courier services, and other
   on-demand marketplaces, to the extent that many new business models were referred
   to as “Uber for X.” Each of these innovations further enhanced the platform’s value
   proposition while generating revenue that the platform owner could share in.
   20 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
   Crucially, this flywheel effect is more than just a network effect. Traditional net­
   work effects make a product more valuable as more people use it – like a telephone
   network or social media platform (Katz & Shapiro, 1994). The generative flywheel
   goes further: each turn not only increases value through greater adoption but also ex­
   pands the possibility space for future innovations. Today’s successful application
   might enable tomorrow’s breakthrough by demonstrating new technical capabilities
   or user behaviors that entrepreneurs can build upon.
   This compound innovation effect helps explain the remarkable durability of plat­
   forms that successfully harness both product and market generativity. While individ­
   ual applications might rise and fall in popularity, the platform’s generative capacity
   continues to enable new waves of innovation, maintaining its strategic relevance and
   value-creation potential.
   But it is not just the behemoths like Google and Apple that can benefit from the
   generativity flywheel. Bubble.io’s competitive advantage lies not solely in its core plat­
   form but in its capacity to empower a diverse user base to innovate and contribute.
   As a no-code platform, Bubble’s initial offering was already highly generative, allow­
   ing users to build a wide array of applications. However, the introduction of a plugin
   marketplace, which allowed users to create and share reusable components, ampli­
   fied this generativity. This move was not a simple feature addition but a strategic shift
   to leverage the creativity of the broader Bubble community, turning them into an ex­
   tended R&D arm for the platform. This allowed Bubble to scale its innovation capacity
   without the need for equivalent growth in internal development resources, something
   that is characteristic of a company that leverages the power of generativity
   Understanding the generativity flywheel provides crucial strategic insights for
   platform creators. It suggests that early design choices should prioritize not just im­
   mediate functionality but the potential for unforeseen innovation. Similarly, market­
   place design should balance value capture with the need to maintain incentives for
   continued experimentation and innovation. Success requires careful orchestration of
   both dimensions of generativity, creating conditions where each reinforces and am­
   plifies the other.
   Generativity as a Deliberate Strategy
   The notion of a generativity advantage is premised on the idea that the patterns of
   generativity can be intentionally leveraged by companies and turned into a source of
   competitive advantage. The generativity flywheel effect described earlier helps ex­
   plain why this advantage, once established, can become nearly unassailable. When
   product generativity combines with market generativity, it creates self-reinforcing
   cycles of innovation and value creation that extend far beyond what any single orga­
   nization could achieve through traditional means.
   Generativity as a Deliberate Strategy 21
   Some of the world’s most valuable companies have achieved their positions by
   mastering this dynamic, benefiting greatly from the unpredicted innovations of others
   on a massive scale. Their success demonstrates that while the path to generative ad­
   vantage may be slower and less predictable than traditional competitive strategies, its
   potential for value creation is virtually unlimited. The generativity flywheel, once
   properly established, can continue spinning and accelerating long after traditional
   competitive advantages would have eroded.
   While it may be possible to benefit from generativity by accident (for example by
   accidentally realizing that your users are putting your products to many uses you
   didn’t design them for), it is prudent to think about how to be deliberate in one’s pur­
   suit of a generativity advantage.
   The most important factor to consider in the pursuit of a generativity advantage
   is that signs of success can be dispiritingly slow to appear. The natural ambiguity of
   generative products and the requirement to wait to see what other users can do with
   them rather than determining their scope yourself are aspects to this kind of business
   that are not easy to handle managerially, and make it difficult to pitch the product to
   investors and other stakeholders. Similarly, generative markets often suffer from the
   famous chicken-and-egg problem in the early stages (Tiwana, 2013). Furthermore, the
   slow growth processes involved in generativity cannot easily be sped up with injec­
   tions of cash and resources, as the processes of getting masses of people to play with
   and innovate with a product cannot easily be time-compressed (Dierickx & Cool,
   1989). However, there are at least three key reasons for why pursuing a generativity
   advantage could be well worth the trouble: the sheer amount of the advantage can be
   colossal, the advantage is likely to be highly sustainable, and the strategy can take
   competitors by surprise.
   Successfully gaining a generativity advantage can be like an electricity generator
   tapping a wire directly into the Sun when everyone else is trying to draw power from
   a coal power plant.6 Obtaining a generativity advantage means removing the con­
   straints of profiting only from your own ideas and innovations, and being unshackled
   from your own knowledge of where to search for ideas and opportunities. Digital
   technology allows companies to profit from the innovations of others on a massive
   scale in incredibly short time periods and with almost zero expenditure of organiza­
   tional resources relative to the value of innovations produced. Furthermore, the
   mechanisms of the generativity advantage allow the firm to benefit from the fruits of
   successful experiments while bearing almost no costs for the failed ones.
   A generativity advantage typically involves the creation of large communities of
   users and enthusiasts upon whom the good part of many traditional burdens of orga­
   nization are distributed. Users are more likely to feel invested in a generative product
   � This analogy is inspired by Schumpeter’s comparison of “bombardment” with “forcing a door” in
   Schumpeter (2013).
   22 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
   because they typically have to invest time and effort to learn to work with it and have
   a sense of ownership over the ideas and innovations they produce with it.7 These
   large communities fuel network effects, increase switching costs and result in forms
   of “lock-in” to the organization’s ecosystem, thereby creating a formidable competi­
   tive “moat” (Parker et al., 2016).
   The sustainability of generativity advantage comes from its distributed nature.
   Unlike traditional competitive advantages that depend on a company’s internal re­
   sources and capabilities, generativity advantage draws its strength from an entire eco­
   system of independent innovators. This distributed agency means that the system’s
   innovative capacity is not limited by any single organization’s knowledge or resour­
   ces. The flywheel effect ensures that each successful innovation makes the platform
   more attractive for future innovations, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that becomes
   increasingly difficult for competitors to replicate or disrupt.
   Generative products are often described as taking on “a life of its own” because
   so much of the agency in their value creation is distributed and located beyond the
   focal firm. This means that the generativity advantage becomes largely independent
   of the firm’s own knowledge, resources, and capabilities and thus immune to the ob­
   solescence of those resources and capabilities. Cultivating a vibrant community of
   users and developers is crucial. This involves fostering communication channels, pro­
   moting knowledge sharing, and recognizing and rewarding contributions. A thriving
   community becomes a collective engine for driving innovation and value creation.
   A key argument in this book is that the most powerful way to incentivize this
   “community” is the market mechanism. Rather than relying on community goodwill
   or volunteerism, I argue that user-innovators must be taken seriously as entrepre­
   neurs: people who can generate profit from their innovations. The market unburdens
   the organization’s resources in the process of engendering user innovations and ap­
   propriating value from them.
   For each innovation conceptualized as a problem-solution match, the firm’s em­
   ployees need not identify the problem nor the solution, nor spend any resources
   building and deploying the solution (Tajedin, Madhok, & Keyhani, 2019). But through­
   out this process the focal firm that created the generative product being innovated
   with in the first place must be humble enough to realize that it is not the center of the
   universe, and that a user innovation may end up being more valuable than any of the
   company’s own innovations. A true hallmark of a company that has embraced gener­
   ativity is that it is entirely prepared for one of its users to find a use case for its prod­
   uct that the company itself had not imagined, and is prepared to help this user profit
   immensely from such an innovation, even more than the company does.
   A generative marketplace allows the firm to access and profit from innovations
   for which it did not have to actively search for. Therefore, the mechanism protects
   � Psychologists and economists refer to this as the “endowment effect” (Knetsch, 1989).
   Generativity as a Deliberate Strategy 23
   against uncertainty and lack of knowledge, because the burden of knowledge is re­
   moved from the shoulders of the organization and distributed in the market. For ex­
   ample, a popular mobile app for architects, interior designers, and real estate profes­
   sionals on the iOS App Store is RoomScan Pro, which uses the smartphone’s cameras
   to generate a floor plan of a property. Apple takes a large cut from sales of this app,
   and yet no employee in Apple needs to know anything about architecture or be in the
   real estate business for this benefit to accrue automatically.
   However, generativity is not just a protection against a lack of knowledge, but
   also a protection against the wrong kind of knowledge. Those cases where an organi­
   zation mistakenly thinks it knows something but doesn’t, or is otherwise blind to its
   own ignorance, can be even more dangerous than a simple “lack of information” type
   of uncertainty (Levinthal & March, 1993; Smithson, 1989).
   Another benefit of generative firm-designed markets is that the firm appropriates
   value from all successful experiments in the marketplace, and yet generally loses
   nothing or incurs no significant costs from the failed experiments. If RoomScan Pro
   had been a failure, Apple would not lose anything. Overall, a generative firm-
   designed market allows the firm to systematically and autonomously profit from the
   ideas and innovations of others on a massive scale, and this is the main reason why
   these markets are such powerful drivers of competitive advantage in the digital era.
   Observers have noted that each individual company is limited in the extent to
   which it can prepare for the future and innovate using traditional organizational
   methods. The dynamism of the market has undermined hope in the possibility of sus­
   tainable competitive advantage (D’Aveni et al., 2010), whereas the market system itself
   continues to thrive, produces innovations regularly, and maintains its dynamism.
   Beinhocker (2007, p. 334) goes as far as to say: “companies don’t innovate, markets
   do.” For him:
   Businesses play the role of interactors in the evolutionary system of market economies. From the
   market’s point of view, each business is an experiment in Business Plan space; some succeed and
   are amplified, while others fail and disappear . . . the process of differentiating, selecting, and
   amplifying Business Plans works better at the level of the market than inside the walls of most
   companies . . . Companies have an inherent disadvantage in that they can never have the same
   diversity of Business Plans as contained in the market as a whole. Nor can they ever perfectly
   mirror the selection pressures of actual markets or have the nearly infinite resources of the capi­
   tal markets to invest in amplifying and scaling up Business Plans that succeed. From the unsenti­
   mental perspective of the evolutionary algorithm, businesses are just experimental grist for the
   evolutionary mill.
   Beinhocker is echoing a similar sentiment from Foster and Kaplan (2011, p. 20):
   Markets, on the other hand, lacking culture, leadership, and emotion, do not experience the
   bursts of desperation, depression, denial, and hope that corporations face. The market has no
   lingering memories or remorse. It has no mental models. The market does not fear cannibaliza­
   tion, customer channel conflict, or dilution. It simply waits for the forces at play to work out . . .
   24 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
   the market simply removes the weak players, and in removing them, improves overall returns.
   Lacking production-oriented control systems, markets create more surprise and innovation than
   do corporations.
   By building a generative marketplace on top of a generative product, companies can
   harness the power of markets that these authors are talking about to their own ad­
   vantage. In addition, due to the boundless nature of new ideas that could be produced
   by various people in a large population, once a generativity advantage takes off there
   is often no limit in sight. Unlike allocative markets where the most efficient possible
   allocation of resources can be envisioned as the “limit” to growth, generative markets
   typically do not have such limits to speak of, because their mechanisms of growth are
   similar to the mechanisms enjoyed by an entire economy. This is why I have sug­
   gested elsewhere that generativity is a mechanism that can indeed lead to sustained
   competitive advantage, despite growing skepticism about whether any competitive
   advantage can be sustained in the long term (Keyhani, 2023).
   Not only can it be a source of sustained advantage, but it can also have another
   key feature of good strategies (Rumelt, 2011): generative advantage can really take
   competitors by surprise. Precisely because generative products are hard to describe
   and understand, and because their full value is still unrevealed (even to their crea­
   tors) in their early stages, they are also easier to dismiss as competitive threats. This
   allows them to go under the radar for quite a while, and when they suddenly take off
   and reach the exponential growth that typically comes with network effects, compet­
   itors are blindsided and find it difficult to respond. If the founders themselves can be
   surprised by user innovations, so can competitors.
   A generativity perspective on business and entrepreneurship emphasizes the idea
   that success often comes not from predicting the future, nor from controlling the fu­
   ture (Sarasvathy, 2001), but from creating environments where unpredictable innova­
   tions can flourish. This insight challenges traditional strategic thinking, which empha­
   sizes planning and control. Instead, platform leaders need to master what we might
   call “structured serendipity” – creating conditions that make valuable accidents more
   likely to happen.
   The Case of Bubble.io: Democratizing Software
   In 2012, Emmanuel Straschnov and Josh Haas embarked on a mission to democratize
   software creation. Their creation, Bubble.io, emerged as a pioneering platform in the
   burgeoning “no-code” movement. Bubble’s core promise was simple yet powerful: to
   enable individuals without formal programming training to build sophisticated web
   applications. This case study explores how Bubble’s approach to generativity has fu­
   eled both its success and its challenges, providing crucial insights for other platforms
   aiming to harness the power of distributed innovation.
   The Case of Bubble.io: Democratizing Software 25
   Bubble is a platform that I have both personally used extensively and studied ex­
   tensively. In collaboration with doctoral student Mahdieh Sarbazvatan, we have col­
   lected extensive archival data from podcasts, blogs, forums, and other sources as well
   as conducted original interviews with Bubble power users and plugin developers.
   Therefore, anecdotes from this case study appear frequently throughout the book.
   The Genesis of Generativity: From Product to Product-Market
   Bubble’s initial value proposition was deeply rooted in accessibility. By abstracting
   away the complexities of coding, the platform empowered a diverse range of users to
   transform their ideas into functional applications. Bubble users and developers we
   interviewed noted that it was able to attract “less sophisticated users” to software de­
   velopment or that it allowed entrepreneurs to overcome the bottleneck of having to
   find a technical co-founder to bring their ideas to life: “they have an idea, they’re non-
   technical themselves, can’t find a co-founder or can’t find a technical co-founder. So
   one day, they decided they’re going to roll up their sleeves and build it themselves”
   (anonymous, personal communication).
   Unlike traditional software development tools that required specialized expertise,
   Bubble offered a flexible, open-ended environment where users could experiment
   and build a variety of applications. This inherent flexibility was key to its product gen­
   erativity, allowing the platform to be applied in ways that even its founders had not
   imagined. One professional Bubble developer that we interviewed said about his con­
   versations with the Bubble team, “So, in almost all the interactions that I’ve had with
   the team and bubble . . . they realize that . . . when they built bubble, they had no
   idea that it could be used for these type of applications” (anonymous, personal com­
   munication).
   The platform’s initial general-purpose nature created ambiguity, which paradoxi­
   cally became a catalyst for user-driven innovation. Users began to build applications
   spanning a broad spectrum of use cases, from simple productivity tools to complex
   business systems. One notable example was the development of a companion app for
   mothers during the pandemic, a use case that highlighted the platform’s versatility
   and unforeseen potential. This application attracted health care-focused developers,
   who then created specialized plugins for medical data handling, further expanding
   the platform’s capabilities and attracting even more users and developers.
   However, Bubble’s transformation into a truly generative ecosystem was not
   solely due to its initial architecture. A key turning point was the introduction of plugin
   and template marketplaces. These marketplaces, which emerged organically over
   time, provided avenues for third-party developers to share and sell custom functional­
   ities and application designs. The decision to open the platform to third-party contri­
   butions was strategic, fostering an environment where the collective ingenuity of the
   user base became a central driver of platform growth. As a result, Bubble transitioned
   26 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
   from a product-centric platform to a dynamic product-market system, where the plat­
   form’s value was constantly being enhanced and extended by its users.
   Navigating Strategic Trade-offs: The Tensions of Generativity
   As Bubble evolved, the company faced a series of strategic trade-offs inherent in man­
   aging a generative platform. The first was the tension between openness and control.
   While encouraging user contributions, the platform had to grapple with the problem
   of quality control. The lack of stringent review processes in the plugin marketplace
   led to the proliferation of low-quality or “copycat” plugins that added little value. This
   created a delicate balancing act between encouraging broad participation and ensur­
   ing a high-quality user experience.
   Another critical trade-off involved balancing ease of use for beginners with ad­
   vanced features for power users. While Bubble’s no-code interface was designed to be
   accessible, the increasing complexity of the platform presented a steep learning curve
   for new users. The platform attempted to address this by introducing features such as
   version control and reusable elements, but these also added to the platform’s overall
   complexity.
   Platform lock-in was also a significant strategic consideration. Because users do
   not own the code of their applications, they are heavily reliant on the platform for
   their continued functionality. Bubble’s easy-to-use interface, paradoxically, is a fea­
   ture that locks users into the platform. This presented a risk for users who were con­
   cerned about the long-term viability of the platform.
   Moreover, pricing strategies presented a considerable challenge. Bubble experi­
   mented with different pricing models for both the platform and the marketplace, try­
   ing to find the right balance between sustainability and accessibility. Controversial
   price changes ignited strong reactions from the user community, revealing the need
   for transparent and equitable pricing mechanisms.
   Finally, community engagement became a vital element of the platform. Bubble
   recognized the value of its user community, using it as a source for new ideas and
   talent. The company worked to foster a supportive environment and encouraged com­
   munity members to contribute to documentation and platform improvements. This
   symbiotic relationship with the community was essential for Bubble’s continued
   growth and innovation, while the company also had to manage the community to pre­
   vent it from becoming a source of low-quality information or a venue for negative
   interactions.
   The Case of Bubble.io: Democratizing Software 27
   Bubble’s Generativity Flywheel: Key Mechanisms at Play
   Bubble’s success in establishing a generative ecosystem can be attributed to several
   key mechanisms that promote innovation and growth.
   First, the platform’s core architecture is inherently generative, exhibiting key
   characteristics such as accessibility, modularity, extensibility, transferability, and
   profitability (although initially integrating a payment platform like Stripe into Bubble
   apps was not that easy). Bubble’s no-code approach ensures that a broad range of
   users can engage with the platform. The plugin architecture and reusable elements
   allow for a high degree of modularity, while the marketplace provides an avenue for
   extending the platform’s capabilities through third-party contributions. The ability to
   share and reuse templates ensures knowledge transfer and the efficient scaling of in­
   novation. The platform’s version control allows users to experiment and track
   changes safely. But perhaps most importantly: profitable software businesses have
   been built on Bubble. The platform has proven itself as more than just a prototype-
   making tool. There are now many cases of profitable businesses as well as startups
   that successfully raised millions of dollars built with Bubble, and the company show­
   cases many of these on their website. Examples include Synthflow AI, Qoins, Dividend
   Finance, Teaddl, Hive Health, Fishburners, Fairie, Flexibple, BluBinder, Messly, and
   others. Just in 2024, over $850 million dollars was billed through apps made on
   Bubble.8
   Second, the platform’s marketplaces act as generative markets, exhibiting thick­
   ness, efficient matching, trust and safety mechanisms, diversity of ideas, interactivity,
   and opportunities for experimentation (see Chapter 7). The large number of users and
   developers creates a vibrant marketplace, where ideas are exchanged and tested. The
   platform facilitates matching buyers and sellers but also allows for the discovery of
   unexpected opportunities. Trust and safety mechanisms, while imperfect, are crucial
   for a thriving marketplace. And the marketplace is a place where diverse ideas can be
   exchanged freely, fostering innovation and growth. The platform’s marketplace is
   rich enough that entire companies like Zeroqode have been established to develop
   and sell Bubble plugins and templates.
   These core mechanisms work together, forming a generativity flywheel. The plat­
   form’s generative properties attract users and developers who, in turn, contribute to
   the ecosystem. This flywheel is further fueled by the marketplace, the active commu­
   nity, and continuous feedback loops, with the platform constantly evolving in re­
   sponse to user needs.

   28 Chapter 2 The Competitive Advantage of Generativity
   Bubble’s Path Forward
   Bubble’s journey as a generative platform offers valuable lessons for entrepreneurs
   and managers interested in harnessing the power of distributed innovation. The plat­
   form’s success lies in its core mission of democratizing software creation. The intro­
   duction of the plugin and template marketplaces has further extended the reach of
   the platform by harnessing the creativity of the user community.
   However, Bubble must also address its weaknesses to ensure long-term viability.
   Improving quality control in the marketplace, managing platform lock-in, simplifying
   the learning curve, providing better tools to plugin developers, and addressing secu­
   rity concerns are all crucial areas for improvement. The company also needs to con­
   tinue engaging its community and to foster an equitable and transparent market­
   place.
   The rise of AI and no-code competitors presents both opportunities and chal­
   lenges. As one developer noted, the integration of AI has the potential to transform
   the platform. However, AI coding platforms like Lovable.dev, Bolt.New, and Replit are
   rapidly taking market share away from no-code platforms like Bubble, while provid­
   ing users with full access to their codebase. Bubble has responded by announcing a
   vision for AI visual development where the power of AI coding will be augmented
   with no-code visual development.9
   Bubble has established itself as a key player in the no-code movement, and its
   approach to generativity provides valuable lessons for other platforms seeking to le­
   verage distributed innovation. Its approach to accessibility, community, quality con­
   trol, platform governance, and the tension between openness and control offer impor­
   tant insights for businesses aiming to create truly generative ecosystems.
   Ultimately, Bubble’s journey highlights a key paradox in the management of gen­
   erative platforms: the very openness that enables external innovation also requires
   careful orchestration to ensure quality and sustainability. Bubble’s future success will
   depend on its ability to manage this paradox and to foster an environment where
   both the platform and its community can thrive. The key, as always with generative
   systems, will be to empower the many rather than rely on the few.

   Understanding Generativity: The Engine
   of Unpredicted Innovation
   The mechanism of generativity lies at the heart of some of the most transformative
   technologies of our time. From the Internet’s astounding growth to the unexpected
   uses of personal computers, generative technologies have repeatedly demonstrated
   their power to drive innovation in ways that their original creators could never have
   anticipated. But what exactly makes a technology generative, and how does this char­
   acteristic enable unpredicted innovation on a massive scale?
   Zittrain’s Conceptualization of Generativity
   The concept of generativity in technology was developed by Jonathan Zittrain, who
   defined it as “a system’s capacity to produce unanticipated change through unfiltered
   contributions from broad and varied audiences” (Zittrain, 2008, p. 70). The concept
   captures a profound insight about how certain technologies enable innovation. Gener­
   ativity is about a system’s ability to channel unexpected innovations from diverse
   contributors who may not be working in concert.
   Zittrain identified five key factors that make a technology generative:
5. Leverage: How extensively the system can make difficult tasks easier
6. Adaptability: How easily the system can be modified for different purposes
7. Ease of mastery: How readily new contributors can learn to use and build upon it
8. Accessibility: How easily people can access and use the technology
9. Transferability: How easily modifications can be shared with others, particularly
   non-experts
   Generative technologies invite people to tinker with them. By design, they accept, im­
   prove, and grow through any contribution that follows a basic set of rules, and
   thereby unshackle their growth from the constraints of traditional managerial control
   over the innovation process. These factors help explain why some technologies be­
   come powerful platforms for innovation while others remain limited in scope. For ex­
   ample, the early personal computer and the Internet both exhibited these character­
   istics strongly, allowing them to overcome more controlled, proprietary alternatives
   like standalone word processors and closed online services such as CompuServe and
   AOL (Zittrain, 2008).
   Generative tools are not always inherently better than their non-generative coun­
   terparts. Appliances are often easier to use and can be safer and more effective. Gen­

   30 Chapter 3 Understanding Generativity: The Engine of Unpredicted Innovation
   erative technologies need not produce forward progress. They invite disruption—
   along with the good things and bad things that can come with such disruption.
   Adding Profitability to Generativity
   In this book I suggest adding a sixth element to generativity in order to emphasize the
   incentives for distributed innovations to occur on a massive scale. This sixth element
   is profitability and the overall augmented model can be called a profit-driven model
   of generativity (see Figure 3.1). A truly generative system not only empowers users to
   create and innovate but also enables them to capture value from those innovations.
   This involves creating mechanisms that allow users to build viable businesses and ca­
   reers around the platform. By taking users seriously as entrepreneurs and providing
   them with the tools and opportunities to profit from their contributions, a system can
   unlock a far greater level of sustained innovation. This profit-driven approach en­
   sures that innovation in a generative ecosystem is not treated just as side-projects or
   curiosities but as serious endeavors.
   The power of profit-driven innovation becomes clear when we contrast it with
   other approaches. While open source projects and community platforms can generate
   enthusiastic participation, they often struggle to sustain professional-grade innovation
   over time. Even sophisticated ecosystem approaches that rely primarily on strategic
   partnerships or intrinsic motivation rarely match the scale and sophistication of inno­
   vation that emerges when participants can build viable businesses around a platform.
   When users can construct sustainable careers and businesses around a platform,
   their relationship transforms from occasional contributors to deeply committed inno­
   vators. This career-level commitment enables crucial dynamics such as the develop­
   ment of deep platform expertise, long-term planning, and sustained investment in so­
   phisticated solutions. Furthermore, the market mechanism acts as a massive parallel
   search process, using price signals to guide both the direction and intensity of innova­
   tion efforts.
   This emphasis on profitability requires platform leaders to fundamentally shift
   their mindset. Rather than viewing the ability of users to profit from their innovations
   on the platform as merely happy accidents, they must intentionally and seriously pur­
   sue the opening of paths to entrepreneurial success for their users. This necessitates
   implementing comprehensive support mechanisms – from clear monetization path­
   ways to robust infrastructure for business growth – that enable users to translate
   their creativity into tangible economic gains.
   The Evolution of Generativity Theory 31
   Figure 3.1: An Extended Model of Profit-Driven Generativity.
   The Evolution of Generativity Theory
   As scholars have built upon Zittrain’s foundation, our understanding of generativity
   has become more nuanced and multifaceted. In this section we review some of the
   more recent literature and conceptual developments in the theory of generativity. Help­
   ful reviews of this literature have been provided by others (Eck et al., 2015; Eck & Ueber­
   nickel, 2016; Thomas & Tee, 2022). Here we discuss a select number of ideas that better
   relate to our discussion in this book.
   Architectural Generativity
   The paper by van der Geest & van Angeren (2023) highlights the concept of “architec­
   tural generativity,” referring to the process of actively soliciting and selectively incorpo­
   rating contributions from complementors—third-party developers and innovators—to
   help evolve the platform’s architecture in unanticipated ways. It is not just about build­
   32 Chapter 3 Understanding Generativity: The Engine of Unpredicted Innovation
   ing on the platform but about shaping the underlying structure that enables inno­
   vation.
   Complementors play a crucial role in this process. They possess a unique under­
   standing of the platform’s capabilities and limitations, having worked intimately with
   its architecture to develop their own complementary innovations. As such, they can
   offer valuable insights into how the platform can be improved, enhanced, and secured.
   Their contributions can take many forms, from suggesting new ways to facilitate access
   to the platform’s technological components to proposing better ways to control and con­
   figure the platform. In essence, complementors can act as “co-architects,” helping to
   shape the platform’s evolution in ways that the platform owner may not have envi­
   sioned.
   A prime example of architectural generativity in action is the case of the Mozilla
   Firefox web browser. Complementors have played a significant role in shaping the evo­
   lution of Firefox’s architecture, contributing to improvements in security, performance,
   and functionality. For instance, complementors have suggested new ways to access plat­
   form components, such as enabling extensions to change the appearance of the user
   interface on a per-window basis. They have also proposed enhancements to security,
   such as adding a special permission to prevent UI spoofing.
   The Coda.io ecosystem also exhibits this kind of architectural generativity. “Most
   SaaS companies provide a solution. But we’re letting you take control in shaping Coda,
   blurring the line between product and community,” explains the company. “When
   growth like this is driven by and for our makers, everyone wins” (Jaume, 2022).
   Extended Generativity Theory
   Fürstenau et al. (2023) have proposed some extensions to generativity theory. They sug­
   gest an integrative view of two distinct lenses found in the generativity literature: The
   Social Interaction View emphasizes the role of social interactions between platform pro­
   viders and complementors in driving innovation. Meanwhile the Product View focuses
   on the expansion of a platform’s functionalities through the addition of new compo­
   nents and features. In their paper Fürstenau et al. (2023) propose two new concepts for
   generativity theory: bounded generativity and inverse generativity.
   Bounded Generativity
   It is generally recognized that generativity allows platforms to evolve in unexpected
   ways, generating new value and attracting an ever-growing user base. However, the
   prevailing assumption that generativity always leads to unbounded growth may be
   an oversimplification. In some cases, generativity can be bounded, meaning that the
   growth it generates eventually stabilizes. This can occur due to several factors, such
   Concluding Thoughts 33
   as the maturing of the platform, the limited pool of potential complementors, or the
   strategic decisions of platform owners.
   Inverse Generativity
   Interestingly, the relationship between generativity and growth can also be reversed.
   In some cases, growth can lead to generativity, a phenomenon termed “inverse gener­
   ativity.” This means that as a platform’s user base expands, it can attract more com­
   plementors and generate more innovation. This relates to the notion of the “Genera­
   tivity Flywheel” discussed in this book.
   The growth of Bubble.io provides an example of “inverse generativity,” where an
   expanding user base attracts more complementors, and in turn fuels further innova­
   tion. As Bubble’s user base grew, it attracted more plugin developers and template
   creators, each bringing unique skills and perspectives. New users learned to use Bub­
   ble in new ways which led to a richer ecosystem, with more diverse functionalities
   and solutions. As the platform grew, the community became more active, creating a
   powerful “generativity flywheel.” This is evidenced by the emergence of companies
   dedicated to Bubble plugin development and maintenance, further enhancing the
   platform’s value for users and its overall generative capacity.
   Concluding Thoughts
   In this chapter we have reviewed the concept of generativity as conceptualized by
   Jonathan Zittrain, as well as more recent developments in the literature that has
   flourished around the concept among scholars of technology and innovation. From
   here we move on to more practically minded chapters that deal with the design and
   management of generative products (Chapters 4–5), followed by chapters that get
   deeper into the idea of generative markets (Chapters 6–7).
   Chapter 4
   The Generativity of Products
   The premise of this chapter is that it is not only broad “technologies” that can be gen­
   erative but also specific products developed by specific companies and organizations.
   Not all products are or should be generative, but when it is desirable to purposefully
   design for generativity, there are certain guidelines that can help us do so.
   An Ode to Possibility
   A generative product is not a finished creation but rather a beginning – a spark that
   ignites countless other sparks. As described by Lehmann & Recker (2019), they are “of­
   ferings that are ever-in-the-making.” Like a seed containing the blueprint of a mighty
   tree, it holds within itself the latent potential for a thousand unexpected blooms.
   Consider the humble spreadsheet. On the surface, it presents itself as a grid of
   empty cells awaiting numbers. Yet in the hands of millions of users, it becomes finan­
   cial models, project schedules, interactive games, works of pixel art, and takes on
   countless other forms, beyond what its original creators could have imagined.
   The true magic of generative products lies in what they enable others to create.
   They could be more akin to languages than to tools – flexible grammars through
   which users can express solutions to problems that the original designers never con­
   ceived. The early personal computer was not valuable because it could run VisiCalc; it
   was valuable because it could run anything that clever humans could dream up and
   translate into code. VisiCalc was a manifestation of that vast possibility space.
   This is why describing generative products can feel like trying to capture smoke
   in your hands. The moment you define them by their current uses, you have already
   limited their potential. They resist categorization precisely because their essence is to
   transcend categories, to shape-shift according to the needs and imagination of their
   users.
   Yet this ambiguity, this resistance to definition, is their greatest strength. They
   can evolve and be repurposed and reimagined as new challenges and opportunities
   emerge. They grow through both careful cultivation by their creators, and through
   the distributed creativity of their users, each adding to the collective pool of possibil­
   ities.
   To create a generative product is to release control while maintaining influence –
   to set in motion a process of innovation that takes on a life of its own. It requires the
   humility to acknowledge that the most valuable uses of your creation may come from
   directions you never anticipated, and the wisdom to design for that beautiful uncer­
   tainty.

   Examples of Generative Products 35
   In the end, a generative product is a platform for possibility, a stage for serendipity,
   an invitation to innovation. And in that invitation lies perhaps the most profound truth
   about generative products: they are meta-products that solve the problem of empower­
   ing others to solve problems we have not yet imagined.
   Examples of Generative Products
   Zittrain’s own examples of “generative technologies” that were the focus of his book
   were the internet and the personal computer: “both were generative: they were de­
   signed to accept any contribution that followed a basic set of rules (either coded for a
   particular operating system, or respecting the protocols of the Internet). Both over­
   whelmed their respective proprietary, non-generative competitors” (Zittrain, 2008, p. 3).
   In general, the concept of generativity is relative rather than binary. It is helpful to
   think of any product as being on a continuum of generativity, although the position of a
   product on this continuum is often determined relative to its alternatives that appear in
   practice. For example, Zittrain considers a hammer to be more generative than a jack­
   hammer, Lego bricks more generative than a prefabricated dollhouse, and a knife more
   generative than a potato peeler. The smartphone is certainly more generative than the
   dumbphone, but the Android operating system and Apple’s iOS have each been genera­
   tive in different ways (Eaton et al., 2011; Remneland-Wikhamn et al., 2011).
   In the software world, a prime example of a highly generative product is the
   spreadsheet. Users of spreadsheet software found so many different value-creating
   uses for it that many consider it to be the first ever “killer app” and the main reason
   behind the rapid adoption of personal computers (Zynda, 2013). Another example is
   the WordPress content management system (Um et al., 2013).
   Other examples of modern cloud software products that have proved to be
   highly generative include the Slack.com messaging software, the AirTable.com cloud
   database software, API connector tools such as Zapier.com and Make.com, no-code
   app development tools such as Bubble.io, Retool.com, and Adalo.com, as well as the
   new generation of dynamic content management systems such as Notion.so and
   Coda.io. These are just a few examples of highly generative cloud software products
   currently available, and most of them fast-growing as of the time of writing. Given
   that Lego bricks are a well understood manifestation of generativity, it is pertinent
   to consider how Ivan Zhao, the founder of Notion, describes their product as a “Lego
   for Software” (Zihnioglu & Zhao, 2020):
   For those who don’t know what Notion is, it’s something you can think of as a combination of
   notes, documents, wiki, project management, all in one product. For many teams and companies,
   Notion can be the collaboration tool to replace email, Slack, Google Docs, Asana, Trello, Evernote,
   and it’s also great for personal use, I’ve probably used it more for personal use as well as for work.
   So it’s extremely flexible. You can almost mold it into any types of tool you want for yourself. We
   call it a Lego for software.
   36 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   As of the time of this writing, a new kind of generative technology, which happens to
   have another meaning of the word “generative” in its title, is taking the world by
   storm and allowing generative products to become even more so by integrating gener­
   ative AI into their features (Keyhani & Mohaghegh-Neyshabouri, 2025). The companies
   that built the first frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) have many paths ahead of
   them in terms of how they evolve their products. A key question they face is to what
   extent they should add features themselves and to what extent they should allow the
   market to build products using their APIs.
   A hallmark of generative products is their ability to open a particular category of
   tools previously used only by specialists, to a broader population of people. For exam­
   ple, no-code tools opened up software development to non-developers, and generative
   AI coding or “vibe coding” tools are again doing that in a new way. AI coding tools
   like Cursor, v0, Replit, Bolt.New and Lovable.Dev are opening software programming
   to the masses like never before. Users constantly post about amazing things they have
   been able to build with these products, at much lower costs than they had been
   quoted from professional developers.1 Even children are empowered to build soft­
   ware with these tools.2
   Generative Products as Sources of Surprise
   Due to their nature, generative products often lead to surprises: user innovations that
   no one anticipated before, including the creators of the generative product, and also
   potential competitors. There are many cases of such surprises. For example, years
   after launching, Bubble co-founder Emmanuel Straschnov shared a new application
   built by a Bubble user that he said “didn’t think was even possible!!” (see Figure 4.1).3
   There are many such cases of surprise among no-code platforms and other gener­
   ative products. Shishir Mehrotra, CEO and co-founder of Coda, describes how he and
   others are regularly surprised by what Coda can do (Mehrotra, 2024):
   Coda has incredibly diverse use cases that would surprise many people. We have millions of
   users and tens of thousands of teams using Coda in innovative ways—from Qualtrics running
   their engineering, product, and design resource planning to Tonal streamlining their operations.
   I’ve met some very surprising Coda customers as well, like the team behind the Sphere in Las
   Vegas managing their video content to professional football and basketball teams planning their
   plays and drafts with Coda to some of the world’s most popular YouTubers managing their fast-
   growing YouTube channels.

   Generative Products as Sources of Surprise 37
   Figure 4.1: The co-founder of Bubble being surprised by a user’s innovation.
   Ivan Zhao, the founder of Notion, describes a company culture at Notion that embra­
   ces learning from user innovations. When asked what the most surprising uses of No­
   tion have been for him, he replied (Zihnioglu & Zhao, 2020):
   Notion roughly can be used as four different products: notes, document, wiki, and project man­
   agement. It’s just a general-purpose database workspace. And so far, plenty of people use Notion
   for those four uses on the consumer side or on the enterprise side. On both consumer and enter­
   prise sides, there’re so many interesting uses, for example, because Notion can be notes and doc­
   ument tools on the internet, so plenty of people use Notion as a lightweight web page or a pub­
   lisher. And on the enterprise side, many companies put up jobs’ pages or publish releases in
   Notion directly. They don’t have to set up their blog, they can just use Notion directly without
   using a CMS or anything.
   It’s amazing how complex people’s project management workflows are. A lot of companies say
   Notion actually gives people a database, where you can customize for any way to run a compe­
   tent team. Some of the customers would talk about how they have set up very intricate work­
   flows on their project management for their companies. And that has been eye-opening, which
   also ties back to our mission of “The people should lead the software, and it should flow into the
   company and not the other way around.”
   Wade Foster, co-founder and CEO of Zapier, said in response to a similar question
   (Yang & Foster, 2021):
   I still remember very vividly, very early on, maybe a year or two in, we got an email from a cus­
   tomer that was like, hey, your product is great. I built an entire business off the back of this thing
   in a weekend. . . . and it sort of made me go, huh, what is that business? . . . There’s actually two
   of them. One is called Seinfeld Quotes, and the other is called Kanye Text . . . the idea is you go to
   this landing page, you put in a phone number for a friend, and you pay either $5, $10, or $20 . . .
   Based on the phone number you put in, it texts that person various quotes at a delay . . . so he
   built this little app in a weekend on Zapier . . . so that, to me, was the first time where I realized,
   wow, the possibilities of what you can build with Zapier far exceeds these simple little integrations.
   We’re actually talking about folks who can build full-on applications, who can automate full-on
   different things. It’s not just about simple integrations anymore. It’s about empowering people to
   build stuff that they didn’t think they could do before.
   38 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   More recently, the rise of generative AI powered by Large Language Models, multi-
   modal models, and diffusion models (for image and video) has been a story full of
   surprises at every turn. In a first study of GPT-4, Microsoft researchers documented
   numerous “remarkable capabilities” including the ability to draw graphical images,
   despite being only trained on text (Bubeck et al., 2023). Beyond researchers, regular
   users around the world regularly share prompts with each other, illustrating how
   they got an LLM to do something interesting or useful. On the flip side, users also reg­
   ularly share stories of how an LLM chatbot said something terrible, incorrect, biased,
   racist, sexist, or in some other way wrong or inappropriate. Researchers have found
   every bias imaginable in the behavior of LLMs (Gupta et al., 2024; Kamruzzaman
   et al., 2024; Navigli et al., 2023) and the companies that make them, have been hard at
   work trying to minimize or mitigate these issues (Jaech et al., 2024). The entire story
   of humanity learning how generative AI works and how to use it, is a process of col­
   lective discovery full of surprise after surprise (Keyhani et al., 2023).
   Generative Products as Vehicles for Serious Entrepreneurship
   A highly generative product is not one where surprises happen by accident; they are
   deliberately nourished as a natural part of a platform for entrepreneurial opportu­
   nity. While characteristics such as leverage, adaptability, ease of mastery, accessibil­
   ity, and transferability lay the groundwork for distributed innovation, it is the possi­
   bility of profit that transforms this potential into sustained and scalable value
   creation. A generative product, therefore, should be designed to empower users not
   merely as innovators but as entrepreneurs. This necessitates a fundamental shift in
   mindset, urging platform leaders to recognize that the most significant sources of
   value derived from their products may indeed be discovered by the users themselves,
   provided they are enabled to profit from these discoveries. This perspective acknowl­
   edges that the most potent driver of sustained innovation lies in empowering users to
   construct viable businesses and careers around the platform, thereby converting oc­
   casional contributions into long-term commitments.
   There have been cases where creators of generative products have failed to see
   the full potential of what they have made. They view user contributions as supple­
   mentary or secondary to the core functionalities designed by them. However, when a
   product is designed with generativity in mind, the user transitions from being a mere
   consumer to a potential entrepreneur. User entrepreneurs should not be limited to
   “accidental” ones (Shah & Tripsas, 2007). If users see that they are being taken seri­
   ously as entrepreneurs, they start to view their innovations on the platform as not
   merely side-projects but serious endeavors that can result in significant economic and
   social value.
   The concept of a generative product as a platform for serious entrepreneurship is
   related to the principle of “residual claimancy” (Alchian & Demsetz, 1972), a term
   Generative Products as Vehicles for Serious Entrepreneurship 39
   economists use to describe the right of innovators to capture a significant portion of
   the value they create. This concept is crucial because it relates to how the incentives
   of the platform’s users align with the platform’s overall success. Digital platforms
   have evolved hybrid forms of residual claimancy that differ fundamentally from tra­
   ditional firm structures. While classical firms concentrate ownership rights in a single
   residual claimant (i.e. the shareholders), platforms typically feature a split structure
   where user-contributors may also have residual claimancy, at least in relation to their
   own contributions (Nicoli & Paltrinieri, 2019). This creates a complex dynamic where
   platforms must balance value capture through their control of coordination mecha­
   nisms while ensuring sufficient returns flow to users to maintain innovation incen­
   tives. The success of platform entrepreneurship thus depends heavily on finding an
   optimal distribution of residual claims – too much value capture by the platform can
   stifle user innovation and participation, while too little may fail to sustain the essen­
   tial platform infrastructure and coordination services. This balance is particularly
   critical because platforms compete not just with other platforms but with the possibil­
   ity of users bypassing intermediaries entirely for un-intermediated exchange, placing
   natural limits on how much value platforms can extract from coordination services
   (Brousseau & Penard, 2007).
   When innovators are confident that they will be the primary beneficiaries of
   their efforts, they are more likely to invest time, resources, and creativity into devel­
   oping novel solutions. A well-designed generative platform must not only enable inno­
   vation but must also ensure that innovators can effectively translate their creativity
   into tangible economic gains. A generative product creates expansive possibility
   spaces for innovation, while profit potential directs sustained investment toward
   valuable opportunities within those spaces.
   To truly empower user-innovators as entrepreneurs, platforms must implement
   comprehensive support mechanisms. These go beyond APIs and SDKs or innovation
   toolkits (Von Hippel, 2001) that allow people to build with the platform. Examples of
   these mechanism include:
   Clear Monetization Mechanisms: A critical requirement is to offer clear, straightfor­
   ward ways for user-innovators to monetize their work. This could involve the crea­
   tion of app stores, marketplaces, or direct revenue-generating features within the
   product itself. The key is that the platform must clearly establish and communicate
   how users can transform their innovations into a source of income. For instance, a
   platform could allow users to create and sell templates, plugins, or custom features to
   other users, establishing a clear link between effort and reward.
   Reasonable Platform Fee Structures: While platform owners need to sustain their
   operations, they must also ensure that the fee structures are reasonable and do not
   unduly burden innovators. Overly aggressive value capture can stifle innovation,
   40 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   while too little can make the marketplace unsustainable. A balanced approach is cru­
   cial, allowing the platform to capture sufficient value while leaving innovators with
   enough profit margin to justify their continued efforts. This may involve lower fees
   for early-stage innovators, tiered fee structures that scale with success, or revenue-
   sharing models that align the platform’s success with that of its users.
   Intellectual Property Protection: A robust system for protecting intellectual prop­
   erty is paramount to encouraging innovation. Innovators need to be confident that
   their creations will not be copied or exploited without their consent. The platform
   should provide mechanisms for users to secure ownership of their innovations, such
   as licensing agreements or copyright protection. This not only motivates innovation
   but also establishes trust in the platform’s commitment to safeguarding the rights of
   its contributors.
   Support for Premium Pricing: Generative platforms should enable users to offer
   premium options for high-value or specialized solutions, allowing them to monetize
   their expertise and specialized capabilities. Premium plugins for WordPress, for ex­
   ample, command prices from hundreds to thousands of dollars annually per cus­
   tomer. The ability to set premium prices allows innovators to offer differentiated
   products and services, enabling them to capture a larger share of the value they cre­
   ate and also invest in developing sophisticated solutions.
   Infrastructure for Recurring Revenue: Providing the tools for recurring revenue
   through subscriptions or memberships is vital for ensuring sustained income streams.
   This is particularly important for innovators who provide ongoing services or up­
   dates. Subscription models provide predictable income for innovators, enabling them
   to invest in long-term development and improvement.
   Tools for Customer Relationship Management (CRM): The most successful plat­
   forms recognize that building a business goes beyond creating a product; it also re­
   quires building relationships with customers. Platforms should equip their innovators
   with the necessary CRM tools, such as features for customer communication, support,
   feedback collection, and user analytics. This allows user-innovators to build a busi­
   ness and brand by establishing direct relationships with their customers and also to
   improve their products based on customer feedback.
   Payment and Subscription Handling: Finally, seamless and reliable systems for
   processing payments and handling subscriptions are essential for removing the com­
   plexities involved in managing financial transactions. Handling some of the complexi­
   ties around payments centrally allows creators to focus on innovation rather than lo­
   gistics. By managing these complexities, the platform allows users to focus on what
   they do best: creating and innovating. For example, Gumroad recently announced
   Designing Products for Generativity 41
   that it is becoming a “merchant of record” and will be able to handle all tax obliga­
   tions for its users.4
   In summary, a generative product that aims to be a vehicle for serious entrepreneur­
   ship must be designed with the intent of empowering user-innovators to build sus­
   tainable businesses around the platform. By ensuring residual claimancy, providing
   clear monetization mechanisms, reasonable fee structures, intellectual property pro­
   tection, support for premium pricing, infrastructure for recurring revenue, effective
   CRM tools, and seamless payment handling, generative platforms become catalysts
   for innovation and economic value creation. This is how a platform truly embraces its
   users not just as consumers but as valued and empowered entrepreneurs. Platform
   leaders who truly understand this do not just tolerate participant profits – they
   actively help their ecosystems build profitable, sustainable businesses and careers.
   Designing Products for Generativity
   Designing for generativity means intentionally crafting products with features that
   empower and encourage the unpredicted innovations of others on a massive scale.
   This section dives deeper into the practical aspects of design for generativity, focusing
   on the specific features that can unlock a product’s generative potential. Software
   products being “digital artifacts” have an exceptionally high potential to be designed
   for generativity if so desired. This is because the inherent characteristics and features
   of digital technology (such as combinatory capacity and reprogrammability) are a
   great fit for generativity. But many of the arguments in this book may apply to non-
   software products as well (such as Lego building blocks).
   The section is organized around a mapping of the characteristics of generativity
   onto a number of more detailed design patterns.
   Leverage: Empowering a Wide Spectrum of Tasks
   A key principle of design for generativity is maximizing a product’s capacity for lever­
   age, meaning its ability to enhance user productivity across a broad spectrum of
   tasks. This goes beyond optimizing for a narrow set of predetermined functionalities
   and demands a more expansive perspective on potential use cases, even those not ex­
   plicitly anticipated by the designers.

   42 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   Consider the example of the mobile phone. Its initial purpose was voice communica­
   tion, but its generative potential became evident as developers and users discovered its
   capacity for diverse tasks like messaging, photography, navigation, and mobile comput­
   ing. This expansion of functionalities was fueled by the phone’s underlying architecture
   and software, which allowed for reprogramming, customization, and the integration of
   new applications.
   To design for leverage, consider the following questions:
   – Beyond the Obvious: What are the non-obvious tasks users might want to ac­
   complish with this product?
   – Versatility: How can the product’s core functionalities be designed to support a
   wide range of potential applications?
   – Emergent Uses: How can we design the product to enable and support uses and
   applications we have not yet imagined?
   Adaptability: Building Blocks for Customization and Evolution
   A hallmark of generative products is their inherent adaptability, meaning their capac­
   ity to be readily modified and reconfigured to accommodate new tasks and evolving
   user needs. This principle is deeply intertwined with modularity, enabling users to
   break down the product into constituent components and recombine them in novel
   ways. The notion of architectural modularity or “decoupling” is key to most genera­
   tive products. For example, the decoupling of software and hardware has been key to
   the generativity of computers: “The essence—and genius—of separating software cre­
   ation from hardware construction is that the decoupling enables a computer to be ac­
   quired for one purpose and then used to perform new and different tasks without
   requiring the equivalent of a visit to the mechanic’s shop” (Zittrain, 2008, p. 14).
   The success of platforms like WordPress and Shopify lies in their modular design,
   empowering users to customize their online presence through a wide array of themes,
   plugins, and extensions. This adaptability allows these platforms to continuously
   evolve and cater to diverse user needs, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of developers
   and users.
   Key considerations for designing adaptability include:
   – Modularity: Can the product be broken down into reusable components that can
   be easily reconfigured?
   – Interfaces: Are the interfaces between components well-defined, allowing for
   seamless integration and customization?
   – Openness: Does the product’s architecture allow for the incorporation of external
   components and modifications?
   Designing Products for Generativity 43
   Ease of Mastery: Lowering Barriers to Entry
   For a product to truly unleash its generative potential, it needs to be accessible to a
   broad audience, not just a select group of experts. This necessitates a focus on ease of
   mastery, meaning the relative effort required for users of varying skill levels to learn,
   understand, and effectively utilize the product.
   The intuitive interface of the Apple iPhone, combined with its comprehensive app
   store and readily available learning resources, exemplifies this principle. This ease of
   mastery played a crucial role in attracting a massive user base and fostering a thriv­
   ing ecosystem of app developers. In addition, users of the iPhone were eager to show
   each other what they can do with their device and how to do it. This community-
   driven learning can be even more powerful than having proper documentation.
   Designing for ease of mastery involves:
   – Intuitive UX: Is the product’s user experience intuitive and easy to navigate,
   even for novice users?
   – Documentation and Support: Is comprehensive and user-friendly documenta­
   tion readily available? Are there accessible learning resources and support
   channels?
   – Community-Driven Learning: Can we foster a community where users can
   share knowledge, tutorials, and best practices? Are there ways to motivate users
   to teach other users?
   Accessibility: Enabling Openness and Participation
   A fundamental principle of generative design is ensuring accessibility, meaning re­
   moving barriers, both technical and social, to building upon, extending, and modify­
   ing the product. This can involve a range of strategies, from offering open APIs and
   providing access to source code to fostering a culture of open collaboration.
   The open-source nature of the Android operating system, combined with its read­
   ily available software development kit (SDK), showcases this principle. This openness
   has led to a diverse and vibrant ecosystem of devices and applications, far exceeding
   what Google, the platform’s originator, could have achieved alone. Furthermore, no-
   code app builders became easier to build for third-party developers for Android com­
   pared to iOS due the more open nature of Android.
   Key considerations for designing accessibility include:
   – Open APIs and SDKs: Does the product offer well-documented and readily acces­
   sible APIs and SDKs that allow developers to integrate with its functionalities?
   – Intuitive No-Code Interfaces for Non-Specialists: Does the product allow non-
   specialists (especially non-developers) to innovate with the product?
   – Open Source: Is the product, or at least parts of it, open source, enabling users
   and developers to directly modify and extend its codebase?
   44 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   – Community Platforms: Are there platforms and channels that facilitate commu­
   nication, collaboration, and knowledge sharing among users and developers?
   Transferability: Facilitating the Spread of Innovation
   The ability to readily share, disseminate, and build upon modifications and innova­
   tions is critical for fostering a product’s generative potential. This principle of trans­
   ferability ensures that individual contributions can be easily replicated, adopted, and
   further enhanced by others, creating a powerful network effect where each innova­
   tion adds to the collective value. While the emphasis in discussions of generativity is
   often on change and adaptability, it is also very important to emphasize that wide­
   spread participation and creative contributions to a product are only possible if the
   product has a well-designed, well-functioning, stable core, around which various in­
   novations can be developed (Baldwin & Woodard, 2009). Without the necessary stan­
   dardization and stability at the core of a product ecosystem, the system as a whole
   becomes too unreliable and thus users are not incentivized to “invest” time, effort,
   and resources in contributing to it.
   The success of platforms like GitHub is deeply rooted in their ability to facilitate
   the transfer of code snippets, solutions, and best practices across a vast network of
   developers using standardized protocols. Any open code repository on GitHub can
   easily be cloned and “forked” for another direction of development. Many repositories
   have thousands of forks. This seamless transferability fuels a virtuous cycle of collab­
   orative innovation, accelerating the pace of development and expanding the plat­
   form’s capabilities.
   Furthermore, while the emphasis in discussions of generativity is often on the “un­
   coordinated” and “unfiltered” nature of contributions, it must also be emphasized that
   the way in which an organization governs the processes by which external contribu­
   tions are solicited, incentivized, and disseminated makes a great deal of difference in
   the ultimate generativity that is achieved by the product and its ecosystem. This gover­
   nance role has been extensively studied in the literature on software platforms, where
   it is often referred to as an “orchestrator” role (Helfat & Raubitschek, 2018).
   Designing for transferability involves:
   – Reusability: Are modifications and innovations possible to transfer and reuse by
   others in different contexts through methods such as cloning or forking?
   – Standardized Formats: Are there standardized formats and protocols that facili­
   tate the sharing and integration of contributions?
   – Community-Driven Dissemination: Does the platform offer mechanisms for
   users to easily share, discover, and adopt innovations created by others?
   Designing Products for Generativity 45
   Profitability: Taking Users Seriously as Entrepreneurs
   Product creators should strategically integrate profitability into the very fabric of
   their generative products. This integration is not a mere afterthought or a secondary
   consideration; rather, it is a foundational element of a successful generative ecosys­
   tem. A truly generative product should be designed to be not only a powerful tool for
   creativity and problem-solving but also a robust platform for entrepreneurship,
   where users can confidently build sustainable businesses and flourishing careers.
   This perspective recognizes that user profitability is not just a happy accident but a
   key design target.
   The financial success of a generative product is inextricably linked to the success
   of its user-innovators. Therefore, by consciously designing with the financial goals of
   user-innovators in mind, product creators can activate a powerful positive feedback
   loop: as users achieve financial success through their creative outputs, they become
   more invested in the platform, which in turn attracts more users and innovations,
   thus leading to a virtuous cycle of growth.
   To achieve this, product creators must ask themselves some crucial questions
   about how the design of their product will impact the profitability of their users:
   – Monetization Pathways: Are there clear, built-in mechanisms for users to trans­
   form their innovations into revenue streams?
   – Value Distribution: Does the fee structure ensure innovators capture a fair
   share of the value they create while maintaining platform sustainability?
   – Business Infrastructure: Does the product provide the necessary tools and infra­
   structure for users to build and scale sustainable businesses?
   – IP Protection: Are there robust mechanisms to protect user innovations and in­
   tellectual property rights?
   By embracing these six pillars of generative design, companies can create products
   that not only fulfill immediate needs but also serve as platforms for continuous evolu­
   tion and unforeseen innovation. These principles, however, are not a rigid formula
   but rather a framework for approaching product development with a generative
   mindset. The specific implementation will vary depending on the product’s nature,
   target audience, and the strategic goals of the organization. However, the underlying
   aim remains consistent: to create products that thrive on change, empower users, and
   unlock a sustainable competitive advantage by tapping into the distributed unantici­
   pated innovations of others at scale.
   As argued earlier, digital products have a particularly high potential for genera­
   tivity. In the next section we investigate this idea in more detail.
   46 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   The Generative Properties of Digital Artifacts
   To understand how digital products are particularly well suited for generativity, we
   must first understand their fundamental properties. Yoo (2010) identifies seven key
   properties that distinguish digital artifacts from traditional physical products: program­
   mability, addressability, sensibility, communicability, memorizability, traceability, and
   associability (see Figure 4.2). Understanding these fundamental properties is crucial be­
   cause they form the technical foundation that makes generativity possible in digital
   products. Below, we explore how these properties can be specifically harnessed to cre­
   ate generative potential.
   Figure 4.2: Yoo’s Seven Properties of Digital Artifacts.
   Programmability: The Foundation of Unlimited Possibility
   Programmability means that a digital artifact can accept new instructions that modify
   its behavior. Unlike physical products whose functionality is fixed at manufacture,
   programmable artifacts can be fundamentally transformed through software changes.
   The case of Notion illustrates this transformative power perfectly.
   The Generative Properties of Digital Artifacts 47
   When a product is truly programmable, three key characteristics emerge that en­
   able generativity:
   First, it can modify its behavior based on new instructions. Unlike a physical tool
   with fixed functionality, a programmable artifact can be taught entirely new patterns
   of operation. When Notion launched in 2016, it offered basic document editing capa­
   bilities. However, its deeply programmable nature meant that users could essentially
   create their own productivity tools within the platform by programming new behav­
   iors and interactions. What began as a simple text editor could be instructed to be­
   have like a database, a project management system, or a customer relationship tool –
   all through the modification of its underlying programmatic rules. The company itself
   was often surprised by what users created – reflecting how programmability enables
   products to evolve beyond their creators’ imagination.
   Second, it can implement conditional logic and decision-making. Rather than fol­
   lowing a single fixed path, programmable products can evaluate conditions and re­
   spond differently based on context. This ability to embed sophisticated decision trees
   allows users to create complex, responsive tools that adapt to different scenarios.
   When Notion introduced its database capabilities, users could program rich condi­
   tional behaviors – showing different information to different team members, auto­
   matically updating related records, or triggering specific actions based on data
   changes.
   Third, it enables behavioral composition – the ability to combine multiple pro­
   grammed behaviors into more sophisticated ones. Users can layer instructions to cre­
   ate increasingly complex functionality, similar to how simple programming functions
   can be combined into more powerful applications. This composability means that
   each new programmed behavior becomes a building block for even more sophisti­
   cated capabilities.
   Generative platforms do not try to anticipate every possible behavior. Instead,
   they focus on making their core functionality as programmable as possible, then let
   their users define new patterns of operation. This approach requires a fundamental
   shift in product strategy: rather than trying to build every behavior yourself, focus on
   building a foundation that enables others to program behaviors you haven’t even
   imagined.
   Addressability: Enabling Targeted Innovation at Scale
   Addressability refers to the ability to uniquely identify and communicate with indi­
   vidual instances of a digital artifact. While this may seem like a purely technical fea­
   ture, it enables a profound shift in how innovation can occur and scale. Unlike physi­
   cal products which exist as identical copies, addressable digital artifacts can be
   individually recognized and modified – enabling precise targeting and customization
   at massive scale.
   48 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   Consider how Amazon’s marketplace leverages addressability to drive innova­
   tion. Every product, seller, customer, and interaction has a unique digital identity, en­
   abling the platform to create highly personalized experiences. Sellers can test new
   product variations with specific customer segments, dynamically adjust pricing based
   on individual buying patterns, and create targeted bundles for different user groups.
   This granular level of control allows for a kind of distributed experimentation that
   would be impossible with traditional retail.
   Three key mechanisms make addressability particularly powerful for genera­
   tivity:
   First, it enables precision experimentation. Every digital instance can be uniquely
   tracked and measured, allowing innovators to run sophisticated A/B tests, gather
   granular feedback, and iterate rapidly based on specific user responses. Spotify uses
   this capability to test new music recommendation algorithms with select user groups
   before broader rollout, learning from detailed interaction patterns to refine their in­
   novation before scaling.
   Second, it allows for dynamic adaptation. Digital products can modify their be­
   havior based on the specific identity and context of each user interaction. Netflix’s
   recommendation system demonstrates this power – the same core platform delivers
   radically different experiences to each viewer based on their unique viewing history,
   preferences, and behavior patterns.
   Third, it enables network-driven innovation. When every interaction is address­
   able, platforms can identify and amplify emerging patterns of value. When every in­
   teraction in Roblox is uniquely identifiable and trackable, the platform can detect
   emerging patterns across millions of gaming sessions that no individual developer
   could discover alone. For instance, when players across different demographics con­
   sistently engage longer with games featuring specific collaborative mechanics, Roblox
   can identify this pattern as valuable. The platform then amplifies these successful in­
   novations through multiple channels. It might highlight these games in recommenda­
   tions, feature them in discovery feeds, or provide insights to developers about what’s
   resonating. For example, when a small studio created a novel approach to team-based
   obstacle courses that showed unusually high retention rates among teenage players,
   Roblox could detect this pattern and elevate it.
   The strategic implication is that digital platforms often do not have to rely on
   “one size fits all” solutions, and can foster an ecosystem of targeted innovations (by
   themselves and by their users) that serve specific niches exceptionally well. This ena­
   bles a long tail of specialized solutions that collectively create more value than a few
   broadly targeted ones ever could. More importantly, addressability allows platforms
   to learn from and amplify the most successful innovations, creating a kind of distrib­
   uted learning system that becomes more intelligent with every interaction.
   The Generative Properties of Digital Artifacts 49
   Sensibility: Creating Context-Aware Innovation
   Sensibility describes a digital artifact’s ability to monitor and respond to its environ­
   ment through various forms of sensors and inputs. It is about the capability of digital
   products to understand and interact with their surroundings. Modern digital artifacts
   can detect location, motion, temperature, light, sound, and numerous other environ­
   mental factors, and then use this sensory information to adapt their behavior or trig­
   ger specific responses.
   The evolution from basic inputs to rich environmental awareness has dramati­
   cally expanded the possibilities for digital innovation. While early computer interfa­
   ces could only sense keyboard strokes and mouse clicks, today’s multimodal AI sys­
   tems demonstrate the transformative power of enhanced sensibility. Multimodal
   Large Language Models (LLMs) can analyze images, interpret technical diagrams,
   read handwritten text, understand spatial relationships, and even follow your com­
   puter interactions by watching your screen. This rich sensory capability enables prod­
   ucts to understand and respond to their environment in increasingly sophisticated
   ways, creating rich data streams that inspire new applications.
   The smartphone provides an earlier illustration of how enhanced sensibility
   drives waves of innovation. Each new sensor added to phones has catalyzed entirely
   new categories of applications. GPS sensors enabled the creation of navigation apps
   and location-based services, fundamentally changing how we move through physical
   space. Accelerometers gave birth to motion-controlled games, transforming how we
   interact with mobile entertainment. Biometric sensors created new possibilities for
   health and fitness applications, allowing phones to become personal wellness moni­
   tors. Camera improvements enabled augmented reality experiences, blending digital
   and physical worlds in novel ways.
   The strategic significance of sensibility lies in its ability to create contextual aware­
   ness that can trigger innovative responses. A digital product with rich sensory capabili­
   ties becomes a platform for innovations that were not previously possible. Moreover,
   these sensors generate streams of data that entrepreneurs can leverage to create en­
   tirely new types of value. The key is not just adding more sensors, but thoughtfully con­
   sidering how enhanced sensibility can enable new forms of interaction and value cre­
   ation.
   This suggests that when designing potentially generative products, leaders should
   think carefully about what types of environmental awareness would enable the most
   valuable innovations in their context. Sometimes, adding a single new type of sensor
   can unlock entirely new categories of possible applications. The goal is not necessarily
   to maximize the number of sensory inputs but to identify the specific types of sensibil­
   ity that will enable the most valuable forms of innovation for your particular eco­
   system.
   50 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   Communicability: Building Innovation Networks
   The ability of digital artifacts to exchange information with other artifacts and sys­
   tems represents a fundamental shift in how innovation can spread and combine.
   While physical products exist as isolated units, digital artifacts can communicate
   through standardized protocols and interfaces, enabling them to work together, share
   resources, and coordinate actions. This communication can be synchronous or asyn­
   chronous, local or remote, and can involve the transfer of data, instructions, or even
   capabilities.
   The story of Zapier illustrates how communicability can transform entire digital
   landscapes. The company began with a deceptively simple insight: what if we could
   make different web applications talk to each other? This vision of universal communi­
   cability has led to thousands of apps being able to interact in millions of different com­
   binations. Any user of Zapier can engage in combinatorial innovation (Varian, 2010)
   with every software that has a Zapier integration, essentially turning web and mobile
   applications into building blocks through a no-code interface.
   Consider how this property has revolutionized workplace productivity. A customer
   email can automatically create a task in project management software. A calendar
   event can trigger team notifications in Slack. A form submission can update multiple
   databases simultaneously. Social media posts can be coordinated across platforms.
   Each of these capabilities represents not just automation but the potential for novel
   combinations and workflows that weren’t possible before.
   Zapier builds on the fact that so many software applications now have Applica­
   tion Programming Interfaces (APIs). But even before Zapier, the rise of APIs was al­
   ready demonstrating the power of communicability. Stripe’s payment processing API
   made complex payment infrastructure accessible through simple communication pro­
   tocols, leading to thousands of innovative applications and allowing many innovators
   to profit more easily from their innovations by adding a stripe integration. Each new
   application doesn’t need to reinvent payment processing – it can simply communicate
   with Stripe’s infrastructure.
   Three key mechanisms make communicability particularly powerful for fostering
   innovation. First, it enables products to work together in novel ways, creating value
   that no single product could deliver alone. Second, it creates ecosystems where inno­
   vations can build on each other, with each new capability becoming available to the
   entire network. Third, it facilitates the rapid spread of innovative solutions, as suc­
   cessful innovations can be quickly integrated into other products through established
   communication channels.
   This suggests that when designing for generativity, leaders should think carefully
   about their communication protocols. The goal is to enable rich exchange of data and
   services, and to open up possibilities for unexpected combinations and interactions.
   The most generative platforms tend to have well-documented, accessible APIs that
   make it easy for others to build on their capabilities.
   The Generative Properties of Digital Artifacts 51
   Memorizability: Learning and Evolution
   Memorizability refers to the capacity of digital artifacts to store and retrieve informa­
   tion about past states, interactions, and events. But this property goes far beyond sim­
   ple data storage – it enables systems to learn from experience and continuously
   evolve. Through machine learning, digital artifacts can transform accumulated mem­
   ories into sophisticated patterns of behavior, allowing them to improve and adapt
   their functionality over time.
   Machine learning has proved to be a powerful tool to incorporate memorizability
   in digital products. Netflix refines its recommendations by analyzing not just what
   users watch but how they watch – tracking pauses, rewinds, and viewing sessions to
   understand engagement at a deeper level. Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist learns
   each user’s unique music taste by examining subtle patterns in listening behavior, from
   skips to song completion rates. Social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok have
   mastered the art of learning from rapid-fire user interactions, using every scroll, pause,
   and like to tune their content algorithms. These systems actively learn from user behav­
   ior, developing increasingly sophisticated models of user preferences and behavior.
   Three key mechanisms make memorizability particularly powerful for innovation:
   First, it allows products to learn systematically from usage patterns. Google
   Search exemplifies this through its ability to remember which results users click on,
   how long they spend on different pages, which queries lead to refined searches, and
   regional and temporal search patterns. The search algorithm continuously improves
   by learning from billions of interactions, understanding not just what people search
   for but why they search and what makes a result valuable to them.
   Second, it enables adaptive intelligence through memory-driven learning. Rather
   than following fixed rules, systems can develop increasingly sophisticated behaviors
   by analyzing patterns in their stored experiences. ChatGPT demonstrates this through
   its memory feature and fine-tuning capabilities. The system can maintain context
   throughout conversations, building on previous exchanges to provide more relevant
   responses. Through fine-tuning, it can even learn new patterns of interaction that
   modify its behavior – learning to write in specific styles, follow particular formats, or
   handle specialized tasks based on curated examples.
   Third, it creates compounding intelligence through transfer learning. Knowledge
   gained in one context can be applied to novel situations, enabling unexpected innova­
   tions. When an LLM learns a new capability through fine-tuning or by seeing a new
   document, it often discovers creative ways to combine this new knowledge with its
   existing knowledge. This combinatorial learning can lead to emergent behaviors that
   were not explicitly programmed.
   The strategic implication is that memorizability opens new doors as to how prod­
   ucts can evolve. Rather than relying solely on deliberate design decisions, products
   can learn and adapt based on actual usage patterns. This creates powerful feedback
   loops where each interaction potentially contributes to future improvements. For
   52 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   leaders seeking to create generative products, this suggests the importance of building
   robust systems for capturing and processing experiences, while ensuring these sys­
   tems respect user privacy and security. More importantly, it highlights how memory-
   driven learning can create products that grow more valuable through use, developing
   capabilities that might surprise even their creators.
   Traceability: Understanding Innovation Patterns
   Traceability means that digital artifacts can maintain detailed records of their activities
   and transformations over time. Every interaction, modification, or event can be logged
   with precise timestamps and contextual information, creating a comprehensive audit
   trail that shows not just what happened but when, how, and in what sequence.
   Git, the version control system used by millions of programmers around the world,
   demonstrates how traceability can transform collaborative innovation. Every change to
   the code is tracked with multiple dimensions of context: who made the change, when it
   was made, why it was made (through commit messages), how it relates to other
   changes, and what problems it solved or created. This comprehensive traceability has
   enabled software development to scale globally in ways that would have been impossi­
   ble without such detailed change tracking.
   GitHub built upon this foundation to create what is essentially a “social network
   for code,” where traceability enables entirely new forms of collaborative innovation.
   When every change is traceable, developers can learn from others’ solutions, under­
   stand how successful projects evolve, identify patterns in software development, and
   build upon others’ innovations. This creates a powerful learning network where each
   contributor’s work becomes a potential building block for future innovations.
   Three key mechanisms make traceability particularly powerful for fostering inno­
   vation:
   First, it enables rapid experimentation with safety. Because every change is
   tracked and reversible, innovators can experiment boldly knowing they can always
   roll back to previous working versions. This reduces the risk of innovation and en­
   courages more adventurous exploration.
   Second, it facilitates learning from history. By examining the trace of changes
   that led to successful outcomes, innovators can understand not just what works but
   how and why certain approaches evolved. This creates a rich context for learning and
   improvement.
   Third, it supports complex collaboration at scale. When every change is traceable,
   large groups can work on the same project without creating chaos. Different paths of
   innovation can proceed in parallel, with the ability to merge successful approaches
   back into the main project.
   Traceability’s impact on innovation extends far beyond software development.
   New AI-powered tools like Cursor, Replit, Bolt.New, and v0.dev are bringing Git-style
   The Generative Properties of Digital Artifacts 53
   version control to a broader audience. These tools allow writers, designers, and other
   creators to track the evolution of their work with the same precision that developers
   use to track code. A writer can explore different plot directions while maintaining the
   original story. A designer can try radical changes knowing they can always return to
   previous versions. When combined with AI assistance, this traceable history becomes
   even more powerful – the AI can analyze successful patterns in the history to suggest
   promising new directions. This democratization of traceability means that complex, col­
   laborative innovation is no longer limited to technical domains.
   Associability: Combining and Recombining
   Associability enables digital artifacts to discover and leverage meaningful relationships
   between different elements in a system. Associability is about understanding the links
   between things – how they relate, why they matter together, and what new value their
   combination might create.
   Consider how Spotify creates value through musical associations. The platform
   understands patterns of musical similarity, listening context, and emotional reso­
   nance. It can recognize that while two songs might be from completely different gen­
   res, they often appear together in user-created workout playlists. Or that certain
   songs, while sonically different, evoke similar moods and work well for focused work.
   These rich associations enable the platform to create personalized experiences that
   transcend traditional music categorization.
   Coda demonstrates a different kind of associability through its relational data­
   bases. Users can create sophisticated webs of interconnected information where
   changes ripple intelligently through the system. A project timeline can be associated
   with team capacity data, which connects to individual workload tracking, which links
   back to project priorities. These associations help teams understand and manage com­
   plex workflows. When someone updates their capacity, all related views and dash­
   boards automatically reflect the implications of that change.
   Three key mechanisms make associability particularly powerful:
   First, it enables semantic understanding. Digital products can recognize not just
   that things are connected but how they are connected. Amazon’s recommendation en­
   gine, for instance, understands that buying a tent suggests an interest in sleeping bags
   not just because they are both camping items, but because they are complementary
   tools for the same activity.
   Second, it supports contextual relevance. The same elements can have different
   associations depending on context. Google Photos can recognize that the same person
   appearing in different photos might be relevant for a family album in one context, a
   work presentation in another, and a vacation memory in a third.
   Third, it creates emergent knowledge. By analyzing patterns of association across
   many users and interactions, systems can discover entirely new categories of relation
   54 Chapter 4 The Generativity of Products
   ship. LinkedIn’s skill endorsements, for example, have revealed unexpected combina­
   tions of expertise that characterize successful careers in emerging fields.
   The power of associability lies in its ability to create new value from existing rela­
   tionships. Associative systems help us understand why connections matter and what
   they mean. This transforms raw data and simple links into rich networks of meaning
   that can drive innovation in unexpected directions.
   Leveraging the Power of Digital for Generativity
   The seven fundamental properties of digital artifacts – programmability, addressabil­
   ity, sensibility, communicability, memorizability, traceability, and associability –
   work together to create unprecedented potential for generative innovation.
   Bubble.io demonstrates how these properties enable generativity in practice.
   Through its plugin system, small independent components can be programmed, com­
   bined, and modified. Different parts of the system can evolve independently while re­
   maining connected. Users can reconfigure the platform for diverse applications, from
   e-commerce sites to project management tools. The platform tracks usage patterns to
   improve over time, while making all this power accessible to non-technical users.
   Several key insights emerge from examining these properties through a genera­
   tivity lens. First, these properties are mutually reinforcing. Programmability becomes
   more powerful when combined with communicability to share new capabilities. Sen­
   sibility gains value when paired with memorizability to learn from environmental
   data. Traceability amplifies associability by making patterns of successful combina­
   tions visible.
   Second, these properties do not automatically create generativity – they must be
   intentionally designed and exposed to enable innovation by others. Simply having the
   technical capability for programmability or communicability is not enough. Leaders
   must carefully consider how to make these properties accessible and usable by their
   broader ecosystem of potential innovators. As we have seen in cases like Notion, Bub­
   ble, and Coda, the most successful platforms find ways to make sophisticated techni­
   cal properties approachable to non-technical users.
   For leaders seeking to harness the generative potential of digital products, this
   suggests several key strategic priorities:
10. Design for extensibility: Make core properties accessible and usable by others.
11. Enable experimentation: Create safe spaces for testing new innovations.
12. Reduce friction: Make it easy to share and build upon successful innovations.
13. Foster connections: Help innovators find each other and combine their work.
14. Learn systematically: Build capabilities to understand and amplify emerging pat­
    terns of innovation.
    The Generative Properties of Digital Artifacts 55
    The properties of digital artifacts make new forms of innovation possible. They help
    users discover, create, and build upon each other’s ideas. When digital products make
    good use of these properties, they create environments where innovation can come
    from anywhere. Over time, this leads to a rich ecosystem of distributed creativity that
    becomes increasingly valuable for everyone involved.
    Chapter 5
    Managing Generative Products
    When designing and managing products with generative potential, traditional prod­
    uct management “best practices” may not always apply. The conventional wisdom
    around entrepreneurship, innovation, and product development often needs funda­
    mental reconsideration when dealing with generative products. There really is some­
    thing different when you’re building a product like Notion, Coda, Bubble, Adalo, Zap­
    ier, AirTable, and other highly generative tools, as I am sure the entrepreneurs who
    took these products to market will attest to.
    There is not much guidance to be found in the literature specifically on manag­
    ing generative products, so this chapter opens the conversation by exploring what
    makes these products uniquely powerful – and challenging – to oversee. We will ex­
    amine their key advantages and limitations, while highlighting the fundamental
    shifts in thinking required to manage them effectively.
    Generative products exhibit distinct patterns of spontaneous, self-directed evolu­
    tion. These patterns allow both the product and its surrounding ecosystem to develop
    along unexpected trajectories with limited centralized oversight. While such un­
    planned developments can manifest within the product itself, they more commonly
    emerge through novel applications and value creation enabled by the product. What
    makes generative products particularly powerful is their capacity to harness the col­
    lective knowledge, creativity, and innovative potential of users outside the organiza­
    tion – enabling possibilities far beyond what the original product creators could have
    conceived or implemented alone.
    While complete relinquishment of control rarely appeals to product creators,
    the relationship between control and generativity involves careful calibration (see
    Figure 5.1). Increased generativity typically requires decreased control from product
    creators (Cennamo & Santaló, 2019), which can affect the security and reliability
    guarantees they can provide to users. However, even highly generative products re­
    main bound by their foundational architecture – their initial design, features, and
    capabilities establish the parameters within which evolution can occur. The scope
    for original innovations by users depends on the creative latitude permitted by the
    product and the supporting infrastructure of tools, standards, and guidelines made
    available to users (Remneland-Wikhamn et al., 2011).
    The Pros and Cons of Generative Products
    Generative products are often described as taking on “a life of their own” which can
    either sound like a treasure trove of autonomous growth, or a quagmire of noisy
    mess, depending on how you look at it. Making products generative isn’t always the

    The Pros and Cons of Generative Products 57
    Figure 5.1: Generative products vs. specific-use products.
    right choice (see Figure 5.2). While powerful when implemented successfully, genera­
    tive products face three fundamental challenges: managing chaos, dealing with ambi­
    guity, and requiring significant time to mature. Interestingly, these very challenges
    can become competitive advantages for companies that successfully navigate them at
    scale.
    Many products are better served by maintaining a specific, controlled purpose
    rather than opening themselves up as platforms for innovation. This is especially true
    when reliability and stability are paramount – qualities that could be compromised
    by increasing generativity. In these cases, product creators need to maintain tight con­
    trol over functionality, something that modern cloud software architectures make in­
    creasingly feasible.
    Even in cases where generativity makes sense strategically, loosening control car­
    ries risks. User innovations aren’t universally beneficial – some can actively destroy
    value. Consider the emergence of computer viruses, which appeared almost immedi­
    ately after networked computing became possible, creating widespread disruption.
    Such negative innovations can severely damage the experience for all users.
    Generative products also face a fundamental challenge of ambiguity, particularly
    in their early stages before a community of users has discovered and shaped their
    primary applications. Describing exactly what these products do proves surprisingly
    difficult, and being too prescriptive risks constraining their potential by imposing lim­
    ited interpretations. SparkFun Electronics encountered this directly with their Rasp­
    berry Pi-related products – after seeing customers discover unexpected uses, they de­
    liberately stopped defining specific use cases for their products (Murphy, 2014).
    This inherent ambiguity creates significant practical challenges, particularly
    around communicating value to stakeholders – from investors to customers to inter­
    nal teams. The personal computer’s early days illustrate this perfectly: in the 1970s,
    explaining its value proposition remained difficult until “killer apps” like VisiCalc’s
    spreadsheet software emerged to demonstrate its practical utility (Zynda, 2013).
    The struggle to define and describe highly generative products creates fascinat­
    ing – and sometimes amusing – challenges for technology journalists and marketers.
    58 Chapter 5 Managing Generative Products
    Figure 5.2: Pros and cons of generative products.
    Early coverage of these products often reveals a striking confusion about their funda­
    mental nature and purpose. Consider the illuminating case of Coda.io: examining five
    different articles referenced in its Wikipedia entry reveals that various authors de­
    cided on entirely different metaphors to capture what the product actually does (Wi­
    kipedia Contributors, 2025). One describes it as a way to turn “docs into apps,” another
    as a spreadsheet alternative, another as an automation tool, one as “Minecraft for
    docs,” and another as a rethinking of documents (see Table 5.1). The diversity of these
    descriptions is so pronounced that just from the headlines one might reasonably con­
    clude they were discussing entirely different products altogether.
    Time represents another significant challenge for generative products. Their path
    to widespread adoption tends to be gradual and methodical, requiring sustained pa­
    tience. This extended timeline stems from the multi-layered process of user engage­
    ment: individuals must experiment with the product, master its capabilities, learn to
    innovate within its framework, share their discoveries with others, and build upon
    collective insights. Typically, a dedicated community of early adopters and innovators
    must emerge to articulate the product’s value in terms that resonate with mainstream
    audiences before broader market acceptance becomes possible.
    However, this temporal barrier carries an interesting strategic advantage for
    companies that successfully scale their generative products. The time investment,
    combined with the emergence of vibrant user communities, creates formidable com­
    petitive moats. These communities of enthusiasts generate tremendous value for the

    developmental risks associated with innovation. These user communities naturally
    evolve into powerful engines of marketing, promotion, and knowledge dissemination.
    Perhaps most significantly, users who participate in these communities tend to de­
    velop deeper emotional investment in the product, driven by their active role in its
    evolution and their sense of ownership over their contributions to its ecosystem.
    A New Mindset for Managing Generative Products
    The distinctive nature of generative products demands a fundamental reimagining of
    how we approach product development and management. Traditional “best practices”
    in entrepreneurship and innovation, while valuable for conventional products, often
    prove insufficient or even counterproductive when applied to generative offerings. At
    the heart of this challenge lies what (Garud et al., 2009) identifies as the inherent “in­
    completeness” of generative products – they are fundamentally open-ended, with pos­
    sibilities that extend far beyond their initial conception.
    This section explores the critical mindset shifts required to effectively shepherd
    generative products toward success. We identify five pivots from conventional prod­
    uct thinking, each accompanied by practical strategies and guidelines for implementa­
    tion (see Figure 5.3).
    60 Chapter 5 Managing Generative Products
    From Fail Fast to Patient Play
    The temporal dynamics of generative products demand a rethinking of traditional
    product development cycles. The conventional wisdom around rapid iteration and
    quick feedback loops (Cagan, 2017; Ries, 2011), while powerful for standard products,
    requires significant adaptation when generativity enters the equation.
    The popular “fail fast” mantra (Hall, 2007) proves doubly problematic for genera­
    tive products. The inherent ambiguity of these offerings makes both “failure” and
    “speed” difficult to meaningfully assess. Organizations often find themselves navigat­
    ing extended periods where their generative product shows mixed signals – neither
    clearly succeeding nor failing by traditional metrics. This reality demands extraordi­
    nary patience, though not infinite tolerance. While clear performance thresholds still
    matter, they tend to be broader and more nuanced than those applied to conventional
    products.
    Perhaps most crucially, organizations launching generative products must em­
    brace a fundamental uncertainty about their creation’s full potential. Rather than dic­
    tating specific uses, they must cultivate the patience to watch users explore, experi­
    ment, and collectively discover applications through organic play and collaborative
    innovation. This represents a profound shift from traditional product management –
    one that requires both humility and strategic restraint.
    From Problem-Solving to Meta Problem-Solving
    Managing generative products requires a shift from addressing specific challenges to
    creating tools that solve entire categories of problems. These platforms might better
    be understood as “meta-products” – tools that enable problem-solving at a higher
    level of abstraction. This elevated perspective naturally leads to product descriptions
    and visions that can seem frustratingly abstract, challenging the conventional wisdom
    about clear, specific value propositions.
    This abstract nature creates an interesting paradox in communication: while
    fewer potential stakeholders may immediately grasp the concept, those who do un­
    derstand it often recognize its transformative potential. Rather than addressing a sin­
    gle pain point, these products tackle entire problem spaces. This broader vision partic­
    ularly resonates with individuals comfortable with abstract meta-cognitive thinking
    (Metcalfe & Shimamura, 1996). Alan Turing exemplifies this meta-level problem-
    solving brilliance: when faced with the challenge of decrypting enemy messages dur­
    ing World War II, he didn’t just create a solution for breaking current codes – he de­
    veloped an algorithmic framework that could adapt to evolving encryption methods
    (Hodges, 2014). This ability to solve problems at a meta-level, while harder to commu­
    nicate initially, ultimately enables far greater impact than narrowly-focused solu­
    tions.
    A New Mindset for Managing Generative Products 61
    From Hypothesis Testing to Hypothesis Development
    Traditional product development frameworks, as outlined by Blank and Dorf (2020),
    rest on three key assumptions: that teams can identify their target users, understand
    the specific problems they are solving, and quickly validate product utility through
    user observation. With generative products, these foundational assumptions require
    reconsideration.
    Instead of jumping straight to hypothesis testing, generative products demand
    more focus on the more exploratory phase of hypothesis formation. This shift mir­
    rors an important distinction in research methodology: while quantitative hypothe­
    sis testing proves invaluable for validating specific ideas, the early “fuzzy front end”
    of innovation often demands more qualitative, exploratory approaches. In research
    terminology, this crucial preliminary phase focuses on “hypothesis development” or
    “hypothesis generation” (Hartwick & Barki, 1994) – creating the intellectual space to
    discover what questions we should be asking in the first place.
    This reframing transforms how we approach product testing in three cru­
    cial ways:
15. Rather than targeting narrow user segments, we expose the product to diverse
    populations without preconceived notions about who might find it valuable.
16. Instead of defining problems upfront, we allow users to discover novel applica­
    tions and use cases organically.
17. Rather than seeking quick validation, we provide users the time and resources to
    explore, experiment, and naturally discover the product’s utility.
    In essence, the early stages of generative product development require fewer “user
    testers” and more “problem hunters” – individuals who can help uncover entirely
    new domains where the product might generate unexpected solutions. This approach
    acknowledges that with generative products, we’re not just validating predetermined
    hypotheses – we are discovering what hypotheses are worth exploring in the first
    place.
    From Customer Feedback to User Tinkering
    Generative products demand a fundamental reimagining of the problem discovery
    process. While conventional products benefit from the rapid validation cycles champ­
    ioned by the lean startup methodology (Blank & Dorf, 2020; Ries, 2011), generative
    platforms require a more expansive and patient approach. The traditional drive to
    quickly establish and capitalize on a narrow product-market fit gives way to some­
    thing more fluid and expansive – a broader, more nuanced conception of how prod­
    ucts create value.
    62 Chapter 5 Managing Generative Products
    This shift requires embracing a different rhythm of discovery. The clear, immedi­
    ate feedback signals that typically validate market segments prove more elusive with
    generative products. Instead, organizations must cultivate the patience to watch users
    explore, experiment, and gradually uncover possibilities. This “tinkering” approach
    stands in marked contrast to the rapid validation emphasized in lean startup thinking.
    Where Blank and Dorf (2020, p. 214) suggest that meaningful validation comes from
    seeing “pupils dilate” in immediate recognition of value, generative products often in­
    spire a quieter initial response – one of curiosity and intrigue rather than instant de­
    light. Our research with Bubble.io users revealed that transformative “aha moments”
    typically emerged only after sustained engagement – after completing tutorials and
    extensively testing the platform’s capabilities against their creative visions.
    To nurture this exploratory process, organizations need to provide two crucial in­
    frastructural elements: modular integrations and robust knowledge bases. Modular
    integrations, facilitated through APIs and flexible component architectures, enable
    users to engage in combinatorial innovation – mixing and matching elements to dis­
    cover novel solutions. Meanwhile, comprehensive knowledge bases support collective
    learning, allowing users to build upon each other’s discoveries and best practices.
    From Traditional to Thick Documentation
    One of the challenges in managing generative products is capturing and learning
    from the rich web of interactions that emerge as different participants engage with
    them. Schoffelen and Huybrechts (2013) introduce the concept of “thick documenta­
    tion” – an approach that goes beyond simply recording features or user experiences
    to capture the complex socio-material assemblies where people and objects mutually
    shape each other.
    Thick documentation aims to reveal what Schoffelen and Huybrechts call the
    “hidden exchanges” – the often invisible ways that different participants (makers,
    users, designers, engineers) interact with and influence each other through the prod­
    uct. For example, when documenting a multitouch table project, thick documentation
    would capture not just the technical specifications and user interface, but also how
    art professionals interact differently with it compared to general audiences, how engi­
    neers’ decisions affect designers’ possibilities, and how users’ unexpected applications
    lead to new features.
    Implementing thick documentation requires creating spaces and mechanisms for
    multiple perspectives to emerge:
    – Live gatherings where participants can demonstrate and discuss their different
    uses and interpretations
    – Collaborative mapping tools that visualize relationships between people, objects,
    and contexts
    Conclusion: Reimagining Product Management for Generativity 63
    – Open documentation platforms where participants can build on each other’s con­
    tributions
    – Guidelines that encourage documenting not just what was done but why and how
    decisions emerged
    Making visible the hidden connections and possibilities in a product, inspires new in­
    terpretations and adaptations. Of course, this approach faces key challenges in prac­
    tice. Motivating busy participants to invest time in documentation can be difficult,
    and treating documentation as composed of dynamic, messy, constantly changing ma­
    terial can cause confusion. It is not trivial to find the right balance of documentation
    thickness.
    Figure 5.3: A new mindset for managing generative products.
    Conclusion: Reimagining Product Management for Generativity
    While generativity is not universally desirable or appropriate for all products, it has
    emerged as a powerful source of competitive advantage among today’s most success­
    ful technology companies. Yet despite its demonstrated importance, we lack robust
    frameworks for understanding and managing generative products. The unique dy­
    namics of these products demand fresh thinking about product management – think­
    ing that moves beyond traditional frameworks and best practices.
    Generative products fundamentally challenge our assumptions about organiza­
    tional agency and control. Where traditional product management assumes central­
    ized direction from the product-creating organization, generative products distribute
    agency in fascinating and often unpredictable ways. The product itself becomes an
    64 Chapter 5 Managing Generative Products
    actor in organizational processes, particularly around knowledge discovery and inno­
    vation.
    However, this shift toward distributed agency doesn’t eliminate the need for
    thoughtful organizational oversight – it transforms it. Product-creating organizations
    must develop new capabilities and mindsets to effectively shepherd generative prod­
    ucts toward success. This involves mastering temporal patience, embracing strategic
    ambiguity, and creating environments that nurture user exploration and innovation.
    This chapter represents an initial expedition into the emerging landscape of prod­
    uct management for intentionally generative products. By highlighting the distinctive
    challenges and opportunities of generative products, I hope to encourage other schol­
    ars and practitioners to develop more sophisticated frameworks for managing these
    powerful but complex offerings.
    In the next chapter we move from product to a somewhat different unit of analy­
    sis: markets. However, in many ways this is a continued discussion of the generative
    product because creators of generative products can orchestrate user innovations in
    marketplaces intentionally built around the generativity of their product.
    Chapter 6
    The Generativity of Markets
    The Market as an Innovation Machine
    When most people think about markets, they imagine systems for matching buyers
    with sellers – like Uber connecting riders with drivers, or Amazon matching shoppers
    with products. This view of markets as primarily allocation mechanisms has domi­
    nated both business thinking and economic theory for centuries, conjuring Adam
    Smith’s famous “invisible hand” metaphor emphasizing the autonomous matching ca­
    pability of markets as their most valuable feature. But this perspective captures only
    a fraction of what markets actually do.
    When Nobel laureate Paul Romer revolutionized economic thinking in the 1990s,
    he made a simple but profound observation: ideas are fundamentally different from
    physical resources. While traditional resources get used up when consumed, knowl­
    edge can be used by anyone without diminishing its value for others. Romer called
    this the “non-rival” nature of ideas (Romer, 1990, n.p.), and this insight helped explain
    something that had puzzled economists for centuries: how do economies keep grow­
    ing despite limited physical resources?
    The answer lies in the extraordinary ability of markets to generate new knowledge
    and ideas. Unlike physical resources that get depleted with use, knowledge builds upon
    itself, creating what economist Edmund Phelps calls “self-refueling systems” of innova­
    tion (Phelps, 2013, n.p.). Think about how the invention of the smartphone created pos­
    sibilities for millions of mobile apps, each of which in turn created new possibilities for
    other innovations. This is the essence of generative growth, where each innovation
    opens doors for countless others.
    Hence, the true power of markets lies not just in resource allocation but in their
    ability to function as innovation generators, systematically incentivizing the distrib­
    uted generation of new knowledge and the opening of possibilities across all market
    participants in a way that no single organization or central planner could do on their
    own. As economist William Baumol argued, free markets are powerful “innovation
    machines” that continuously enable and incentivize breakthroughs by their partici­
    pants (Baumol, 2002), thereby functioning as self-refueling systems (Jacobs, 2000).
    This view challenges traditional economic thinking that viewed markets purely as
    mechanisms for efficient resource allocation (Backhouse & Medema, 2009).
    Consider the contrast between Uber and Apple’s App Store. Uber’s marketplace is
    masterfully designed for allocation – efficiently matching drivers with riders in real-
    time. But it is intentionally not designed for generativity. Uber doesn’t want its drivers
    innovating with new types of services or experimenting with different business mod­
    els. The company maintains tight control over the core transaction, optimizing for re­
    liability and predictability.
    https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110779639-006
    66 Chapter 6 The Generativity of Markets
    The App Store, on the other hand, is explicitly designed for generativity. While it
    provides basic allocation functions (connecting app developers with users), its real
    power comes from enabling and incentivizing countless developers to create applica­
    tions that Apple itself could never have conceived. When the creators of RoomScan
    Pro developed their innovative floor-planning app that uses iPhone sensors to auto­
    matically generate property layouts, Apple did not need to know anything about ar­
    chitecture or real estate to profit from their innovation. The company simply created
    conditions where such innovations could emerge and flourish.
    Flipping the Agency Problem on Its Head
    What makes generative marketplaces particularly powerful is their ability to transform
    traditional organizational challenges into advantages. Consider the classic “agency
    problem” in business – the challenge that arises when one party (the agent) has more
    information than another (the principal). In traditional organizations, this information
    asymmetry is seen as a problem to be solved through monitoring and incentives (Eisen­
    hardt, 1989; Fama, 1980; Ross, 1973).
    But generative marketplaces flip this dynamic on its head. Instead of trying to
    overcome information asymmetries, they leverage them. The fact that potential inno­
    vators know more about their own capabilities and ideas than the platform owner
    becomes an advantage rather than a liability. When you reframe what agency theory
    would call “adverse selection” (Akerlof, 1970, n.p.) as self-selection, the agency prob­
    lem becomes an agency opportunity, and the threat of cheating is turned into the pos­
    sibility of learning, or even the possibility of profiting without needing to learn at all.
    This self-selecting power of markets becomes particularly potent at scale, because
    it automates knowledge discovery by distributing it to all market participants. Rather
    than having to identify and approach potential innovators (an impossible task when
    you don’t know what innovations you need), generative marketplaces allow those
    with relevant knowledge to self-identify and step forward. This process bypasses
    what economists call “meta-uncertainty” or the idea of “unknown unknowns” – the
    problem of not even knowing what it is that you do not know (Tajedin et al., 2019).
    The Power of Large Numbers
    As participation in a marketplace grows, it develops what economists call a “law of
    large numbers” effect. Individual errors or failed experiments get absorbed by the sys­
    tem, while successful innovations rise to the top. When market scale is large enough,
    the competition mechanism brings about necessary adjustments by inducing others “to
    fill the gap that arises when someone else does not fulfill the expectations” (Hayek,
    2002, p. 18). This effect manifests in several ways: failed experiments are balanced by
    Markets as Learning Systems 67
    successful ones, poor quality offerings are outcompeted by better alternatives, manipu­
    lation attempts are diluted by honest participation, knowledge gaps are filled by diverse
    participants, and innovation dead-ends are offset by breakthrough discoveries.
    Consider how this plays out in the App Store. While many apps fail to gain traction,
    the system as a whole continues to thrive and generate value. The platform’s scale
    means that even if the majority of experiments fail, the successful ones can still create
    enormous value. And crucially, Apple bears virtually no cost from the failed experi­
    ments while automatically capturing value from every success. On the contrary, as of
    the time of this writing, Apple takes a minimum $99 annual fee just to grant the devel­
    oper account the privilege to publish apps on the App Store, regardless of their perfor­
    mance.
    The Power of Collective Intelligence
    Beyond their role as innovation engines, generative markets serve as powerful knowl­
    edge aggregation systems. Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek was among the first to
    recognize this property, noting how markets effectively mobilize and coordinate frag­
    mented knowledge dispersed among countless individuals (Hayek, 1945).
    Consider prediction markets, where participants effectively “bet” on future out­
    comes. The aggregated prices in these markets often prove remarkably accurate at
    forecasting everything from product launches to election results (Wolfers & Zitzewitz,
    2004). This demonstrates what James Surowiecki (2004) famously called “the wisdom
    of crowds” – the remarkable ability of large groups to collectively achieve outcomes
    that elude even expert individuals.
    In fact, the price signal has long been viewed by economists as the central coordi­
    nation mechanism of markets, enabling the efficient matching of supply and demand
    (Smith & Butler-Bowdon, 2010). The sufficiency of the price signal has also been used in
    arguments favoring deregulation and smaller government (Friedman, 2009). But today’s
    generative marketplaces go far beyond simple price signals in aggregating knowledge,
    and owners of digital platforms typically have much more control points to leverage
    than a national government trying to influence an economy. To view the price signal as
    “enough” of a coordination mechanism for a firm-design marketplace would be to miss
    an enormous opportunity to nurture a more dynamic economy on your platform.
    Markets as Learning Systems
    Perhaps the most powerful aspect of generative markets is their ability to function as
    autonomous learning systems. Unlike traditional organizations where learning is
    often centralized and directed, generative markets create distributed learning net­
    works where:
    68 Chapter 6 The Generativity of Markets
    Failed Experiments Create Value: Even unsuccessful innovations generate valu­
    able learning. As Phelps (2013) notes, failed ideas aren’t wasted – they indicate
    where not to look further and often spark insights that lead to eventual successes.
    Knowledge Builds Cumulatively: Each innovation becomes a foundation for fu­
    ture innovations. When mobile game developers discovered the power of “free­
    mium” business models, that knowledge quickly spread and evolved across the
    entire app ecosystem.
    Cross-Pollination Accelerates Learning: Solutions from one domain often in­
    spire breakthroughs in others. The success of Uber’s matching algorithm has
    influenced everything from food delivery to home services.
    Learning Spreads Automatically: Successful innovations naturally propagate
    through the system as profit incentives drive others to observe, adapt, and im­
    prove upon them.
    The power of this learning system becomes clear when we examine how mobile app
    marketplaces have evolved. The first iPhone apps were relatively simple utilities and
    games. But as developers learned from each other’s successes and failures, they col­
    lectively discovered:
    – New business models (subscriptions, freemium, in-app purchases, etc.)
    – Novel user interface patterns (such as Tinder’s swipe mechanism)
    – Creative uses of device capabilities (such as using the phone’s camera to scan
    barcodes or QR codes)
    – Innovative marketing techniques (like allowing users to unlock features by
    watching ads)
    – Breakthrough application categories (such as “disappearing content” apps and
    features inspired by Snapchat)
    On the Terminology of “Market Generativity”
    When economists like Hayek, Romer, and Phelps discussed the dynamic, innovative
    power of markets, they didn’t use the term “generativity.” Instead, they spoke of mar­
    kets as discovery processes, innovation machines, or self-refueling systems. Yet when
    we examine what makes markets so powerful at generating new possibilities, we find
    it maps perfectly onto Jonathan Zittrain’s definitions of generativity. Recall for exam­
    ple, “a system’s capacity to produce unanticipated change through unfiltered contri­
    butions from broad and varied audiences” (Zittrain, 2008, p. 70).
    Think about how this definition applies to dynamic marketplaces:
    – “Unanticipated change” – Like when the App Store enables innovations Apple
    never imagined
    – “Unfiltered contributions” – Direct participation without central control
    On the Terminology of “Market Generativity” 69
    – “Broad and varied audiences” – Diverse participants bringing different perspec­
    tives
    – “System’s capacity” – The market’s built-in mechanisms for enabling innovation
    Hayek captured this essence when he noted that market discoveries can be “unpre­
    dictable and on the whole different from those which anyone has, or could have, de­
    liberately aimed at” (Hayek, 2002, p. 10). This is very much in line with Zittrain’s no­
    tion of generativity, even though Hayek didn’t explicitly use that term.
    There is another crucial reason why “generativity” is a term I apply to markets in
    this book: in the digital age, marketplaces aren’t just organic phenomena that emerge
    naturally – they are products that we intentionally design and build. When econo­
    mists wrote about markets as innovation machines, they were typically describing
    naturally occurring markets in the broader economy. But today’s digital platforms
    give us unprecedented control over marketplace architecture and operation.
    This shift from observing markets to designing them changes everything. We are
    no longer just trying to understand how markets generate innovation; we are actively
    creating systems to maximize their generative potential. Just as a product designer
    might optimize a smartphone for durability or a car for fuel efficiency, we can now
    optimize marketplaces for generativity. Since the previous chapters of this book ap­
    plied the notion of generativity to the unit of product, and marketplaces can essen­
    tially be designed as products, the idea of marketplace generativity seems like a natu­
    ral extension of product generativity.
    The next chapter goes deep into ways in which we can intentionally design and
    orchestrate markets for generativity.
    Chapter 7
    Designing Markets for Generativity
    Most of our thinking about how to design and operate marketplaces is still stuck in an
    older paradigm that views markets primarily as allocation machines – efficiently
    matching buyers with sellers. As argued in the previous chapter, while this allocation
    function is important, it captures only a fraction of what marketplaces can do. The
    distinction between allocative and generative markets matters because the architec­
    ture needed to support the allocation function is not by itself sufficient to support gen­
    erative marketplaces. The traditional focus on the features that market design econo­
    mists have identified for improved allocation such as “thickness, non-congestion, and
    safety” (Roth, 2008), while important, is insufficient. As Edmund Phelps noted in his
    analysis of innovative economies, we need to consider other crucial elements such as
    “the desire of people to attempt innovation, peoples’ capabilities at innovating, and
    the latitude society gives to innovators” (Phelps, 2015, p. 256).
    In this chapter our focus is to review a variety of practical design choices and
    managerial decisions that go into the design and management of marketplace plat­
    forms where the ultimate goal is not just allocation but also generativity, in a way
    that leads to a self-refueling value-creating system.
    The Three-Layered Architecture
    I suggest that we view allocation as only one layer—albeit a crucial one—in a full ar­
    chitecture for generative marketplaces, and that we add a generation layer to priori­
    tize the kinds of features that drive distributed innovation. However, since we know
    that profiting from distributed innovation is far from trivial, I suggest adding a third
    layer to the architecture focusing on value capture or appropriation. Therefore, the
    recommendations for market design in this chapter are organized around an architec­
    ture for generative marketplaces with three distinct but interconnected layers:
18. An allocation layer that provides the basic market functions such as matching
    buyers and sellers, processing transactions, maintaining order and safety, and
    creating incentives for participation.
19. A generation layer that enables and encourages innovation by providing the tools
    and environments needed for innovation: knowledge sharing systems, collabora­
    tion channels, development tools, and community spaces.
20. An appropriation layer that ensures value can be sustainably captured, such as
    business models that allow the platform owner to collect fees or “tax” the system
    in a way that is deemed reasonable enough to continue incentivizing partici­
    pation.
    https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110779639-007
    The Allocation Layer: Building the Foundation of Markets 71
    Getting this architecture right is critical because generative marketplaces can become
    extraordinarily valuable assets for companies that successfully build and operate
    them. They are essentially knowledge search devices that aren’t limited by the cogni­
    tive or organizational capacity of their owners. Unlike traditional research and devel­
    opment that requires directed search, generative marketplaces can facilitate the dis­
    covery of opportunities that their creators never even thought to look for.
    The true power of a generative marketplace comes from how these layers rein­
    force each other. A well-designed allocation layer creates incentives that drive activity
    in the generation layer. The generation layer produces innovations that create value,
    which the appropriation layer can then help distribute value in ways that keep the
    entire system sustainable and encourage more innovation.
    Think about how these layers work together in the App Store:
    – The allocation layer connects developers with users and handles transactions
    – The generation layer provides tools, documentation, and APIs that enable inno­
    vation
    – The appropriation layer ensures both Apple and developers can capture value
    The appropriation layer is particularly tricky because overly aggressive value capture
    can stifle innovation, while too little can make the marketplace unsustainable. Apple’s
    long-running troubles and legal battles over its commissions, platform fees, and rules
    around in-app purchases is a perfect illustration of how hard this balancing act can be.
    Beyond these three internal layers, generative marketplaces are also profoundly
    shaped by their broader context – the economic, social, cultural and institutional envi­
    ronments in which they operate. While marketplace designers cannot directly control
    these external factors, understanding how to influence, leverage and adapt to them can
    be conducive to success. From economic institutions that provide fundamental frame­
    works for property rights and transactions to cultural attitudes that enable or inhibit
    innovation, to the concentrated knowledge networks of urban centers, these contextual
    elements can either amplify or constrain a marketplace’s generative potential.
    In the following sections, we will examine each layer in detail, as well as addi­
    tional external or contextual factors (see Figure 7.1). While some of the concepts that
    will be discussed have deep roots in economic theory, our focus will be practical and
    centered on one key question: how can business leaders create and manage market­
    places that are self-refueling systems (Jacobs, 2000) and innovation machines (Bau­
    mol, 2002) rather than just matching mechanisms?
    The Allocation Layer: Building the Foundation of Markets
    Before we can enable breakthrough innovations or foster creative experimentation,
    we need to build a rock-solid foundation that makes basic market functions possible.
    This foundation is what I call the allocation layer. In traditional marketplaces, this

    layer focuses solely on efficiency—matching buyers with sellers, processing transac­
    tions, and maintaining order. Think of how Uber’s marketplace relentlessly optimizes
    for quick, reliable matches between riders and drivers. It is true that Uber is not a
    generative marketplace (because it doesn’t do much beyond allocation), but allocation
    is something that every market needs to get right, regardless of whether or not it is
    designed to be generative. Therefore, even generative marketplaces have something
    to learn from allocative marketplaces like Uber.
    The allocation layer rests on three fundamental pillars referred to in the market
    design literature as thickness, non-congestion, and safety (Roth, 2008). Here, we use
    slightly different labels to capture the core ideas: market thickness, efficient matching,
    trust and safety. See Table 7.1 for a summary of the ideas in this section.

    Market Thickness: Building the Foundation for Generative Innovation
    The first crucial pillar of the allocation layer is market thickness – having enough par­
    ticipants on all sides of the marketplace to enable reliable matching and transactions.
    This challenge is particularly acute for generative marketplaces because they need to
    attract participants who might not immediately see the relevance of the market to
    their needs. Thickness essentially reduces transaction uncertainty – with enough ac­
    tive participants, both sides gain assurance that they can find matches, or find alter­
    native matches if any particular transaction fails.
    Relative market thickness has been a key advantage for the Bubble no-code plat­
    form compared to other no-code platforms, given its head start in this market. With
    many potential users of no-code software development platforms being hesitant to
    adopt this new approach to software development, Bubble enjoys the advantage of
    having enough professional developers, freelancers, and plugin developers avail­
    able to provide options for users, and conversely enough users to incentivize the
    developers. Over time, this moat becomes deep enough that new players will have a
    difficult time competing with Bubble, even if they have some other highly desirable
    features.
    In order to create thickness, almost every marketplace faces what observers have
    called the “cold-start problem” (Chen, 2021, n.p.) or the chicken-and-egg dilemma: par­
    ticipants on each side will only join if there are enough participants on the other side
    (Parker et al., 2016). However, building a marketplace on top of an already generative
    product is often feasible because a community of innovators has already been at­
    tracted to the product as users, and they are often curious to learn from other users
    and eager to monetize their own innovations with the product. This can be seen for
    example in the community of users who started building custom GPTs as soon as this
    feature was made available in OpneAI’s ChatGPT product. In what follows we discuss
    some of the strategies that can be used to help build market thickness, despite the
    chicken-and-egg problem.
    Strategic Approaches to Building Thickness
    One crucial strategy involves ensuring the platform provides immediate value even
    without a marketplace having formed around it, a.k.a. “single player mode” (Rachit­
    sky, 2023). This can be achieved through core features that provide standalone value,
    educational content and resources, tools that help participants prepare for market­
    place activity, and data or insights that benefit early participants. Notion exemplifies
    this approach with their template marketplace. Before launch, they built a powerful
    core product that attracted millions of users. When they launched the marketplace,
    they not only had a built-in audience but ensured template creators could use their
    own templates internally even if no one purchased them. This meant creation had im­
    mediate value regardless of marketplace success.
    The Allocation Layer: Building the Foundation of Markets 75
    Sometimes the platform itself needs to act as a market participant initially to en­
    sure that the model works and to kindle the supply side in order to attract users on
    the demand side. Uber famously used this approach in their evolution from a taxi
    fleet provider to a marketplace matching riders and drivers. Apple’s App Store
    launched with a suite of Apple-created apps, ensuring users had immediate value
    while third-party developers came on board. When Coda launched their Packs mar­
    ketplace, they created several essential Packs themselves to demonstrate the plat­
    form’s potential while attracting third-party creators.
    Successful platforms often leverage existing networks by partnering with estab­
    lished brands and communities, working with influencers who can bring their fol­
    lowers, building integrations with complementary platforms, and creating coopera­
    tive relationships with existing market players. Webflow exemplifies this through
    their partnerships with design communities and agencies. They worked with promi­
    nent design firms and educators who already had audiences interested in web design,
    helping them quickly build marketplace participation.
    Building Robust Participation Mechanisms
    One of the most powerful architectural choices involves enabling participants to play
    multiple roles in the marketplace. Notion’s users naturally move between creating
    and consuming templates, customizing them for their needs, and sharing modified
    versions back to the marketplace. Even large organizations both consume templates
    and share their workflow templates back to the community. This fluidity between
    roles helps build marketplace activity organically.
    Successful marketplaces create non-monetary incentives beyond direct financial re­
    wards, using reputation systems, gamification, and community recognition to drive par­
    ticipation. Adalo’s marketplace, for instance, highlights successful creators through
    their showcase section and community spotlights, creating social incentives for partici­
    pation.
    Managing Strategic Growth
    Successful marketplaces often start small and focused rather than trying to serve ev­
    eryone immediately. Consider Facebook’s early strategy of focusing exclusively on col­
    lege campuses – first Harvard, then other Ivy League schools, before eventually open­
    ing to everyone. This concentrated approach helped them build the density needed
    for network effects to take hold. Similarly, while many digital marketplaces can theo­
    retically serve global markets immediately, successful ones often focus geographically
    at first.
    Another important tool that can be leveraged by marketplace owners is to use
    strategic subsidies or incentives. For example, it often makes sense for a platform
    owner to lose money on at least one side of the market (provide services at a cost) just
    to increase the user base for a period of time (Rochet & Tirole, 2003, 2006). This is
    76 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    common practice in many platform businesses. For example, video game consoles are
    often sold at below cost so that the platform can later make money by “selling” its
    large user base to game developers through royalties and licensing fees. Ad-supported
    business models from newspapers to various websites all provide their software to
    users for free so that they can grow one side of the market such that the other side
    (advertisers) are willing to pay for their attention.
    Innovation contests can also be leveraged (Terwiesch & Xu, 2008). When Coda
    launched their Packs marketplace in 2022, they implemented a $1 million “Maker
    Fund” to incentivize early creators. But importantly, they didn’t just offer money –
    they provided development support, promotional opportunities, and special access to
    beta features. This comprehensive approach helped attract not just developers but do­
    main experts who could create specialized tools.
    By establishing a strong foundation of market thickness – through strategic focus,
    standalone value creation, robust participation mechanisms, and careful evolutionary
    growth – platforms create the conditions necessary for a dynamic marketplace. With­
    out sufficient engaged participants, even the best tools for innovation will go unused.
    But with the right foundation in place, platforms can focus on enabling and incentiv­
    izing unpredicted innovation at scale.
    Efficient Matching: Balancing Market Clearing with Discovery
    The second pillar of the allocation layer addresses a sophisticated design challenge:
    how to structure the matching process to optimize both the efficiency and the effec­
    tiveness of the matching process. This idea is what economists call “non-congestion” –
    a state where “transaction speed is sufficiently rapid to ensure market clearing but
    slow enough to allow participants to seek alternatives” (Agrawal et al., 2015, p. 977).
    Even marketplaces that appear to operate instantly must carefully orchestrate
    the temporal dynamics of matching. Consider Uber’s apparently instantaneous driver
    matching. The app actually spends crucial seconds allowing multiple drivers to bid
    for your ride while letting you evaluate options like price and arrival time. This brief
    but essential window of discovery and choice enables market efficiency through what
    we might call “productive friction” – just enough structure to make matching effi­
    cient, but sufficient time and space for proper evaluation.
    This temporal balancing act becomes particularly critical in marketplaces built
    around knowledge work and innovation. The matching process must be efficient
    enough to maintain marketplace momentum but deliberate enough to enable in­
    formed decisions. On platforms like Upwork, both sides need adequate time to evalu­
    ate fit: clients must review portfolios and compare proposals, while freelancers need
    to assess potential clients and projects. Yet, when a job ad is posted on Upwork, pro­
    posals can start coming in a matter of minutes. By allowing clients to set screening
    The Allocation Layer: Building the Foundation of Markets 77
    questions, the platform provides a mechanism for clients to weed out irrelevant pro­
    posals and find the best matches.
    Search and recommendation systems play a crucial role in achieving non-
    congestion. Comparison mechanisms need to make evaluation straightforward while
    surfacing the kind of detailed information that can help market participants make
    matching decisions. The Upwork platform uses its own AI algorithm to suggest best
    matches, and shows badges on freelancer profiles that have particular accomplish­
    ments or success rates. It allows clients to invite keyword-matching freelancers or
    freelancers they have worked with before to apply for their new job posting in addi­
    tion to the proposals that come in regularly. The platforms allows clients to short-list
    and have chat conversations or meetings with potential hires before finalizing a hire.
    On the other side, freelancers are also shown detailed information about the history
    of the client, how many hires they have made, and how much money they have spent
    on the platform.
    Trust and Safety: Creating a Secure Space for Innovation
    As Kornberger et al. (2017) argue, trust and safety systems form an essential “evalua­
    tive infrastructure” that enables both basic market function and generative inno­
    vation:
    – Rankings and ratings that help participants navigate quality
    – Recognition systems that create innovation incentives
    – Discovery mechanisms that surface available offerings
    – Reputational capital that creators can leverage
    The core challenge lies in balancing protection with possibility. Marketplace operators
    must create enough trust for participants to confidently experiment while avoiding
    controls that would stifle creativity. The safety and trust infrastructure for generativ­
    ity requires systems that simultaneously protect and enable innovation.
    Building Trust Through Layered Infrastructure
    Looking across successful generative marketplaces, we see a number of key trust
    mechanisms working together:
    – Rules and Standards. As Tadelis (2016) notes, clear marketplace rules create the
    predictability participants need to invest in innovation enable. The rules aren’t
    just restrictions – they make experimentation less risky.
    – Identity and Verification. Authentication systems help alleviate the problem of
    fake identities, such as agency organizations pretending to be individuals, or
    other types of misrepresentation.
    78 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    – Payment and Settlement Infrastructure. Secure, reliable payment systems re­
    duce transaction friction and risk.
    – Community-Powered Quality. Many marketplaces effectively distribute trust-
    building functions to their communities, leveraging distributed governance.
    – Intellectual Property Protection. A key motivator for innovators in many cases is
    to know that the effort they put into their innovations can be protected as a source
    of advantage at least for a reasonable amount of time. Our study of the Bubble eco­
    system platform revealed an interesting trade-off here: Bubble plugin developers
    learned immensely about how to build plugins for Bubble from “free” plugins that
    were forced by the platform to be open source but also benefited from keeping the
    source code closed for plugins that they wanted to sell for profit.
    The Generative Power of Trust
    When designed thoughtfully, these systems provide the security infrastructure for
    generativity – the confidence that enables participants to experiment with novel of­
    ferings, invest in creating high-quality contributions, try products from unknown cre­
    ators, build on others’ innovations, and share knowledge and best practices.
    As marketplaces grow, maintaining trust becomes both more crucial and more
    challenging. Technology provides powerful tools for building trust at scale through:
    – Reputation systems that create ongoing incentives for quality
    – Automated monitoring that can quickly detect issues
    – Community moderation tools that leverage collective intelligence
    – Clear dispute resolution processes that maintain confidence
    The most successful marketplaces thoughtfully combine automated systems with
    human oversight and community participation. However, with the new availability of
    LLM-driven AI agents, many of these monitoring and moderation mechanisms are
    being automated in unprecedented ways. For example, on his popular website Nomad
    List (nomads.com), Pieter Levels has automated the entire process of content modera­
    tion on community forums with AI agents, and comments that, as a result, it has
    never been “so chill and friendly and free of spam as now.”1
    Conclusion: The Allocation Layer as Innovation Infrastructure
    The allocation layer provides the fundamental infrastructure that every marketplace
    needs to function. Market thickness ensures enough participants for meaningful

    transactions. Efficient matching helps participants find and evaluate opportunities
    without getting overwhelmed. Trust and safety systems create the confidence needed
    to participate, experiment, and innovate in the market.
    Bubble.io’s marketplace has made efforts to address market thickness, efficient
    matching, and trust and safety, with varying degrees of success. To foster market
    thickness, Bubble has focused on specific segments and supported a diversity of plu­
    gins, although this also brings the challenge of managing the quality of these resour­
    ces. Efficient matching is supported through search and review systems, but there is
    still room for improvements to aid in discovery of useful solutions. Trust and safety
    are partially addressed through user ratings and documentation, but there is a lack of
    formal quality control or IP protection mechanisms, leaving developers to have to
    take their own measures. In the Bubble.io ecosystem, trust is fostered through a com­
    bination of community engagement and user-driven accountability. The platform en­
    courages users to publicly share their work, which fosters a culture of transparency
    and mutual support. The community ethos is generally to credit and support each
    other’s work, which adds to the culture of trust. The forum serves as a space where
    users ask for help, share ideas, and build relationships, which also increases trust and
    mitigates the fear of failure, encouraging more active participation and experimen­
    tation
    In the next section, we will explore how the generation layer builds on this foun­
    dation to actively foster innovation and drive value creation at scale.
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale
    The generation layer is where the true magic of marketplace generativity happens.
    While the allocation layer creates the foundation, the generation layer helps us go be­
    yond the mental model of markets as matching mechanisms and transforms a market­
    place into an engine of continuous innovation. This is where users become creators,
    where ideas collide and combine in unexpected ways, and where a platform can tap
    into the distributed creativity of thousands or millions of minds.
    When economists use the term “knowledge spillovers” (Glaeser et al., 1992, n.p.)
    to refer to the flow of ideas between people and projects that sparks new innovations,
    it can sound like something that happens by accident. This terminology is again
    rooted in the idea that the main function of markets is matching, and anything else
    that happens is an “externality” or “spillover” effect that wasn’t in the original model.
    But spurring innovation at scale doesn’t happen by accident. Successful platform com­
    panies that pursue a generativity advantage intentionally design and orchestrate
    their generation layers to amplify creativity and propagate innovation at scale.
    A fundamental insight about the origin of innovations is that they emerge from
    connecting and recombining existing ideas in novel ways (Johnson, 2011; Pentland,
    80 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    2014). The role of the generation layer is to make these connections more likely and
    more fruitful. This requires at least two critical elements identified by Nobel laureate
    Edmund Phelps (2013): The range and diversity of ideas available for combination,
    and the mechanisms that enable those ideas to interact and combine effectively.
    These ideas guide the discussion in this section (see Table 7.2).

    The Power of Diversity for Innovation
    The more user-innovators you have on your platform, the more innovation experi­
    ments are being conducted by these users. A larger number of experiments is espe­
    cially important when the statistical distribution of potential outcomes is heavy-
    tailed, because it increases the chances of outlier successes (Jamshidi et al., 2025;
    Keyhani & Jamshidi, 2025; Taleb, 2020). And indeed, phenomena involving entre­
    preneurship and innovation do typically have heavy-tailed power law distributions
    (Crawford et al., 2015).
    Creating generative thickness is not just a numbers game, although quantity is
    important. When participants bring different backgrounds, personalities, education,
    training, and thought processes to the ecosystem, this diversity expands what com­
    plexity theorists call the “adjacent possible” – the space of potential new combinations
    that could emerge from the given state of a system (Kauffman, 1993). In a system
    richer with diversity, innovative ideas that were previously out of reach become
    more likely to form from the rich soup of possible connections, fueling the emergence
    of unforeseen directions in research, collaboration, or design. Over time, this inter­
    play of diverse ideas enriches the collective imagination and paves the way for discov­
    eries, products, and solutions that would have been impossible in a less diverse envi­
    ronment.
    The diversity of participants not only enriches the supply side but also the de­
    mand side, and these two have a reinforcing effect on each other (Rietveld & Eggers,
    2018). With enough diverse participants, creators feel more confident trying novel ap
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale 83
    proaches since there’s likely to be some audience interested in their innovations. This
    reduces the risk of experimentation and creates a virtuous cycle – more diversity
    leads to more experimentation, which attracts even more diverse participants. When
    users are willing to try new things, suppliers are more likely to experiment with
    novel offerings. Conversely, diverse innovations on the supply side expand users’ ho­
    rizons, opening up new possibilities they hadn’t considered before.
    Airbnb illustrates how this insurance effect works in practice. The platform
    began with a narrow focus on air mattresses in spare rooms (hence the original name
    “AirBed & Breakfast”). But by cultivating diversity on both the host and guest sides,
    they created conditions where hosts felt safe experimenting with increasingly novel
    offerings, and guests were interested to try them. Today the platform includes every­
    thing from treehouses to converted airplanes, each finding their specific audience
    within the marketplace’s diverse user base.
    Building this kind of generative diversity requires intentional design choices that
    sometimes go against traditional marketplace wisdom. Imagine if Uber encouraged
    the same kind of diversity among its drivers as Airbnb encourages among its hosts.
    The platform would risk the reliability that users expect from it. While many plat­
    forms optimize for rapid matching of the most common use cases, generative market­
    places need to preserve and highlight diversity even when it creates some friction.
    They need discovery mechanisms that expose participants to different perspectives
    and possibilities rather than just showing them more of what they already know
    they want.
    The Intellectual Orders of Generativity
    One crucial yet underappreciated role of marketplace designers is to harness diversity
    in such a way that it actively disrupts groupthink and echo chambers that often in­
    hibit creativity (Janis, 2013; Pariser, 2011). This means creating mechanisms for con­
    structive dispute, dissent, and intellectual debate. As Mike (2017) argues, encouraging
    innovation in an economy depends on creating “intellectual orders” within economic
    systems—sets of shared rules that enable participants to consult established knowl­
    edge, freely test novel ideas, and engage in genuine persuasion when ideas conflict.
    Wikipedia exemplifies how this disciplined search can unfold in practice. Though
    Wikipedia is not a traditional marketplace, it relies on various alternative incentives
    (e.g., reputational benefits, shared interest in accurate content) and has well-defined
    rules and norms for debate. Contributors consult an evolving body of articles, propose
    edits grounded in reliable sources, and discuss contested points on Talk pages to
    reach some measure of consensus. This process illustrates Mike’s (2017, n.p.) emphasis
    on “consultation” (through existing articles and citations), “competition” (as editors
    challenge one another’s claims), and “persuasion” (when participants negotiate im
    84 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    provements to the content). The systematic structure of Wikipedia’s editorial process,
    combined with ongoing discussions, helps refine knowledge and reduce bias.
    Similarly, Twitter’s (X.com’s) “Community Notes” system—and its prospective
    adoption by other social media—shows how platforms can encourage constructive
    disagreement rather than merely amplifying polarized opinions. Community Notes in­
    vites users to attach context or corrections to tweets, with the broader community
    then evaluating whether those notes are helpful. This arrangement echoes Mike’s ob­
    servation that openness and structured dialogue can spur meaningful debate.
    Embracing Outliers as Potential Game Changers
    Successful marketplaces increasingly recognize the value of outliers and unusual
    cases. Rather than optimizing solely for the most common or popular use scenarios,
    dynamic, knowledge-generative platforms create avenues for spotlighting disruptive
    ideas that can seed major breakthroughs. As Kuhn (2009) argued, anomalies and un­
    expected observations often serve as the catalysts for paradigm shifts in scientific
    communities. Translated into marketplace design, these “outliers” can open up new
    directions of inquiry, revealing untapped sources of value before they become main­
    stream. Embracing them, therefore, is a deliberate strategy to remain on the frontier
    of innovation rather than settling into intellectual complacency.
    The importance of embracing outliers is greater when the statistical distribution
    of potential innovations is more heavy tailed. It is well known that contexts involving
    entrepreneurship and innovation often have heavy-tailed power law distributions
    (Crawford et al., 2015). In such settings, it is always possible that new outliers may
    emerge, and that they could be much better than the best outcomes observed so far
    (Taleb, 2020).
    A variety of generative platforms such as Kickstarter, Figma, Notion, Bubble, and
    others have a section on their website devoted to highlighting various user innova­
    tions, and also highlight these in various email communications. These mechanisms
    can be leveraged to highlight unconventional or experimental approaches that illus­
    trate possibilities of what can be done on the platform that other users may not have
    thought of. Highlighting the outlier “rock stars” (Booyavi & Crawford, 2023) or “lead
    users” (Von Hippel, 1986) who often pioneer new solutions ahead of mass adoption is
    a great practice for embracing outliers. However, platforms would benefit from
    highlighting a diversity of lead users so as to avoid converging too quickly on ideas
    around the best use cases and standard design patterns championed by a narrow
    group of lead users, and to keep the design space open for reimagining possibilities.
    Burt’s (2010) work on “structural holes” shows how bridging disconnected or mar­
    ginal networks can spark creative insights, precisely because novel combinations of
    knowledge emerge where mainstream and fringe perspectives intersect. In parallel,
    minority influence theory highlights how original viewpoints can persist against con
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale 85
    sensus to drive deeper exploration (Nemeth & Kwan, 1987). For platform marketpla­
    ces, building in mechanisms—like specialized forums, public “debate” tools, or discov­
    erable experimental channels—that amplify ‘maverick’ ideas can help keep the sys­
    tem fresh, flexible, and primed for the kind of breakthroughs that sustain both the
    platform and its participants over the long term.
    At the same time, platforms must remain vigilant about disinformation and algo­
    rithmic manipulation that can hijack the very openness meant to foster innovation.
    Research suggests that false stories spread faster and further than factual information
    in networked environments (Vosoughi et al., 2018), underscoring the importance of
    thoughtful content moderation and community guidelines. Unconstrained digital
    spaces risk reinforcing filter bubbles, thereby amplifying extreme or misleading con­
    tent (Pariser, 2011). To strike the right balance, marketplaces can deploy transparent
    policies and user-driven checks—such as community fact-checking, multi-stakeholder
    review boards, or iterative feedback loops—that prevent harmful distortions while
    still encouraging unconventional thinking. This helps ensure that the pursuit of out­
    lier ideas remains constructive and that the marketplace’s generative potential is not
    undermined by misinformation.
    In the end, the arguments in favor of embracing outliers and the clash of ideas in
    generative platforms are rooted in the same arguments as those in favor of free
    speech in society. As eloquently stated by John Stuart Mill in his treatise On Liberty
    (1859, p. 33):
    If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opin­
    ion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the
    power, would be justified in silencing mankind . . . the peculiar evil of silencing the expression
    of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation;
    those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they
    are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost
    as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its colli­
    sion with error.
    Making Ideas Interactive: The Communication Infrastructure
    While diversity creates the potential for innovation, it is the interactions between
    ideas and people that pave the path for that diversity to bear fruit. The market de­
    signer has significant control over who talks to who and when—and this control can
    be leveraged strategically to enhance generativity.
    Many platform companies make the mistake of viewing communication features
    simply as ways to facilitate transactions. They focus on mimicking face-to-face com­
    munication or providing basic messaging capabilities. But the most successful genera­
    tive marketplaces recognize that digital communication can actually enhance knowl­
    edge sharing in ways that in-person interaction cannot.
    86 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    Consider these unique advantages of digital communication:
21. Thoughtful Articulation: Digital formats allow participants to carefully compose
    and edit their ideas before sharing them, often leading to clearer expression of
    complex concepts.
22. Rich Media Integration: Unlike verbal communication, digital platforms enable
    the seamless combination of text, images, code snippets, and interactive elements
    to convey ideas more effectively.
23. Permanent Record: Digital communications can be searched, referenced, and
    built upon long after they occur, creating a growing knowledge base.
24. Scalable Distribution: Once captured, knowledge can be shared with any num­
    ber of participants at near-zero additional cost.
    Facilitating the interactivity of ideas can be viewed as bridging distances that other­
    wise hinder their interaction. We can think of multiple such dimensions of distance
    (Madhok et al., 2015):
    – Geographic Distance: Digital tools enable collaboration across continents, elimi­
    nating physical barriers to innovation (Forman & Zeebroeck, 2012).
    – Cognitive Distance: Marketplaces can bridge domains of expertise, allowing ideas
    from different fields to collide and recombine (Hein et al., 2019).
    – Temporal Distance: By recording and archiving knowledge, platforms connect
    today’s innovators with past insights and future possibilities (Consoli & Pa­
    trucco, 2009).
    – Social Distance: Communication tools allow diverse communities and individuals
    to collaborate, overcoming cultural or social barriers (Bleakley et al., 2022).
    Bridging ideas requires a vibrant knowledge sharing ecosystem that not only aggre­
    gates existing insights but accelerates the creation of new ones. From community fo­
    rums and discussion spaces that facilitate the cross-pollination of ideas to comprehen­
    sive documentation and tutorials that help with learning curves (van der Geest & van
    Angeren, 2023), these systems ensure that the collective intelligence of the market­
    place is continuously captured, refined, and built upon. By codifying and disseminat­
    ing knowledge across time and space, they transform the marketplace into a self-
    reinforcing engine of intellectual growth.
    However, this ease of information sharing comes with its own challenges. As
    Jones, Ravid, and Rafaeli (2004) found in their research, information overload can ac­
    tually hinder effective knowledge exchange. Successful platforms need mechanisms
    to help users “separate the wheat from the chaff.”
    Platform designers face an interesting strategic tension when it comes to commu­
    nication features. On one hand, limiting communication between parties can help pre­
    vent users from side-stepping the platform to avoid fees. On the other hand, these
    same limitations can severely hinder knowledge flows that drive innovation.
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale 87
    Upwork’s evolution illustrates this balance. While the platform maintains certain
    restrictions to prevent disintermediation, they have created rich communication
    channels that allow detailed discussion of methods, tools, and approaches between
    clients and freelancers. These discussions often generate valuable knowledge that
    benefits the broader community – freelancers learn new techniques, clients better un­
    derstand best practices, and the overall quality of work on the platform improves.
    Social Processes and Serendipitous Discovery
    One often-overlooked aspect of generative marketplaces is the role of social processes
    in driving innovation. Studies show that creativity flourishes when the brain is
    nudged to connect unexpected dots, often by stepping away from the familiar and en­
    countering new inputs in unfamiliar settings. For example, creativity researchers
    have found that sudden insights—the “Aha!” moments—often arise when the mind
    shifts its focus or takes a detour from routine thought patterns (Pentland, 2014). If cre­
    ative breakthroughs happen when people are exposed to diverse, seemingly unrelated
    ideas in new contexts, then if you have any control over the environment in which
    people ideate and innovate, you can try to make these exposures more likely. This is
    sometimes referred to as enabling “structured serendipity” (Zweig, 2011).
    Generative marketplaces can intentionally design for structured serendipity by
    creating environments where diverse participants and ideas naturally collide. This
    might mean fostering interdisciplinary exchanges through open forums, affinity
    spaces (Gee, 2017), curating tools that enable unexpected combinations, or even pro­
    viding recommendation systems that surface unconventional projects or solutions.
    Platforms like GitHub and Bubble excel at this, as developers stumble upon coding
    innovations or modular plugins from unrelated projects that inspire novel applica­
    tions. By ensuring that participants are exposed to a broad variety of inputs, these
    marketplaces mimic the process of venturing into new intellectual terrain and uncov­
    ering hidden opportunities.
    In the digital world, one of the main available types of space for structured seren­
    dipity is online forums. Generative platforms can foster community forums that en­
    courage open discussions beyond specific transactions, publishing community-driven
    stories and insights, integrating gamification elements to make exploration engaging,
    and linking with social media profiles to enable informal interactions. For instance,
    Bubble’s community forums have become a strategic asset, where users share tips,
    techniques, and resources and connect with developers and plugin creators, often
    through organic side-effects of other conversations. As one Bubble user explained, “If
    I had a question and didn’t know how to do something, I would look on the forum.
    And usually, I would find someone talking about that thing I didn’t know how to do.”
    88 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    The Memory Challenge: Building Collective Knowledge
    Market economies are themselves mechanisms for the accumulation of knowledge, or
    as Metcalfe & Ramlogan (2005, p. 661) put it, “a system for standing on the shoulders
    of giants.” Knowledge grows in marketplaces through processes of variation, selec­
    tion, and refinement—a process fueled by the constant interplay of individual insights
    and collective sensemaking. When you have the ability to influence the digital com­
    munication infrastructure underlying a marketplace, you can take steps to improve
    these processes and enhance the market’s organizational memory system.
    Digital platforms can capture, organize, and make searchable the accumulated
    wisdom of their communities. The key is to design systems where knowledge is
    actively maintained, improved, and applied. Platforms that excel at this task provide:
    – Searchable archives that allow users to quickly locate relevant, high-quality in­
    formation.
    – Knowledge structuring tools like tagging, categorization, and hierarchy that
    make vast repositories navigable.
    – Mechanisms for updating and refining knowledge, so that outdated or inaccu­
    rate content doesn’t erode trust or utility.
    – Linking capabilities that connect related information, enabling users to uncover
    patterns and relationships they might not have anticipated.
    Consider Stack Overflow. Its design goes beyond solving individual coding problems.
    Through its structured Q&A format and reputation system, the platform ensures that
    accurate and useful information rises to the surface, while conversations and clarifi­
    cations provide rich context. Over time, this system has captured a growing repository
    of development knowledge that has effectively captured the collective wisdom of mil­
    lions of developers in a form that is immediately useful to others.
    The Experimentation Engine: From Natural Selection to Active Learning
    Digital platforms have a unique opportunity to influence the structure, rules, and fea­
    tures of their ecosystems in ways that amplify the knowledge accumulation process de­
    scribed by Metcalfe and Ramlogan (2005). By designing platforms to actively facilitate the
    capture, refinement, and dissemination of knowledge, they can accelerate and enhance
    the knowledge accumulation process. This involves building systems that intentionally
    channel the natural variation, selection, and refinement processes that drive innovation.
    Unlike traditional markets, which rely on organic and often slow mechanisms
    for coordinating knowledge, digital platforms have direct control over key affordan­
    ces such as data collection, algorithmic sorting, and user interaction design. This
    control allows them to lower the cost of experimentation, curate and synthesize in­
    sights, and ensure that knowledge is more easily shared and applied across their
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale 89
    user base. Platforms that embrace this role as knowledge orchestrators can trans­
    form the uneven and unpredictable accumulation of knowledge into a more dy­
    namic, intentionally catalyzed process of innovation. They can collect detailed data
    about both successes and failures, analyze patterns, and share insights in ways that
    would be impossible in conventional settings.
    A helpful model of how platforms can orchestrate knowledge accumulation in the
    market is a cycle that can be referred to as the “Experimentation Engine” (see Figure 7.2).
    In this approach, the platform actively strives to:
25. Make experimentation low-cost and accessible
26. Capture knowledge from both successes and failures
27. Analyze patterns across many experiments
28. Broadcast insights back to the community
29. Enable quick application of learnings to new experiments
    Figure 7.2: The Experimentation Engine.
    A strong example of the “Experimentation Engine” in a generative ecosystem is Open­
    AI’s API platform for its GPT models, although many of the same practices are increas­
    ingly adopted by other companies in the industry as well (such as Anthropic with its
    Claude models and Google with its Gemini models). This platform fosters a vibrant
    ecosystem where developers and businesses can experiment, share insights, and
    build distributed innovations at scale. The practices of igniting the experimentation
    engine in this ecosystem include:
    90 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
30. Low-cost and accessible experimentation: OpenAI provides an accessible API
    that allows developers and companies to quickly integrate AI capabilities into
    their applications. With flexible pricing tiers and a pay-as-you-go model, it lowers
    the barriers to experimentation. This encourages a wide range of users—from
    startups to enterprises—to test new ideas without significant upfront investment.
31. Capturing knowledge from successes and failures: The platform collects feed­
    back and usage data from API interactions, capturing insights into what works
    well and where users encounter challenges. Developers also share their successes
    and struggles through forums, GitHub projects, and third-party communities like
    Slack or Discord groups, contributing to a growing knowledge base.
32. Analyzing patterns across experiments: OpenAI actively analyzes data across
    use cases to understand patterns in how the API is being used. This informs im­
    provements to the models (e.g., making them more aligned, versatile, or reli­
    able) and helps surface best practices for building applications with AI. Public
    examples, like identifying common failure modes of the models, show the plat­
    form’s ability to extract generalizable insights from distributed experimenta­
    tion. Anthropic’s comprehensive research reports based on anonymized data
    from user interactions with Claude are also a great example.
33. Broadcasting insights back to the community: OpenAI shares knowledge
    through detailed documentation, case studies, blog posts, and public updates on
    improvements to its models and best practices for use. For example, it publishes
    guidelines on prompt engineering or shares examples of successful integrations
    to inspire the community. This transparency ensures that insights flow back to
    innovators, helping them refine their approaches.
34. Enabling quick application of learnings: OpenAI provides cookbooks with ex­
    ample code snippets in multiple programming languages. These resources enable
    developers to quickly adopt and implement insights from the platform’s broader
    ecosystem of experiments. By offering clear, practical examples—such as how to
    fine-tune a model, orchestrate agents, or use structured outputs—OpenAI ensures
    that users can immediately apply best practices and take advantage of their prod­
    uct’s leading edge features.
    It is important to note that implementing just one or two parts of the experimentation
    engine well is not enough. Each element of the cycle depends on the others and if one
    element is missing or doesn’t work well, the circuit breaks.
    The Platform’s Privileged Knowledge: Broadcasting the Frontier
    What makes platform companies uniquely powerful in their ability to foster experi­
    mentation engines is their access to market activity data and the ability to aggregate
    learnings from distributed experiments in real-time and at scale. Unlike governments,
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale 91
    which have limited monitoring capabilities, or individual companies, which can only
    learn from a limited number of experiments, platforms can gather granular data
    about all experiments in their ecosystem. Not all of them appreciate the strategic
    value of doing so.
    Platform companies have unprecedented access to what economists call “frontier
    knowledge” (Agarwal & Gaule, 2020) – the latest insights about the leading edge inno­
    vations, and about what is working and what is not in their marketplaces. Access to
    frontier knowledge is of the utmost importance for innovators who want to build on
    this knowledge and expand the frontier (Iaria et al., 2018). The most successful plat­
    forms actively broadcast this knowledge to help their entire community level up
    more quickly.
    They do this through various channels:
    – Regular state-of-the-platform updates
    – Trend reports and analysis
    – Best practice guides
    – Highlighting and promoting exemplars
    – Case studies of successful innovations
    – Analysis of common failure patterns
    This approach leverages the position of the platform operator to intentionally spur
    “knowledge spillover” effects (Agarwal et al., 2007; Glaeser et al., 1992), such that the
    lessons learned by one participant benefit the entire community. The key is making
    this knowledge sharing systematic rather than leaving it to chance, taking advantage
    of the platform owner/operator’s privileged knowledge from access to all the market
    activity data.
    The Shopify app marketplace shows how this can work in practice. Their
    platform:
    – Provides developers with detailed analytics about how their apps are being used
    – Identifies common user pain points across similar apps
    – Highlights emerging opportunities based on user behavior patterns
    – Alerts developers to potential issues before they become serious problems
    The interesting thing about a platform ecosystem as vibrant as Shopify’s, is that the
    platform does not carry the burden of knowledge orchestration alone. The ecosystem
    has such strong incentives, that a plethora of websites and online resources have
    emerged beyond Shopify itself that contribute to knowledge dissemination for Shopify
    merchants. But these third parties typically do not have access to the privileged
    knowledge of the platform itself, and so they rely on secondary sources such as inter­
    views, case studies, and observations of trends and patterns that are visible to the
    public.
    Access to frontier knowledge is so coveted by entrepreneurs in profitable market­
    places that third-party tools will step in to provide this knowledge if the platform it
    92 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    self does not. Leaving it to third-party providers may actually be a beneficial strategy
    if the platform thinks there may not be a single optimal solution that can be devel­
    oped in-house, and that a variety of approaches may need to be explored. An example
    of this is the elaborate ecosystem of tools for sellers that have developed around the
    Amazon platform, such as JungleScout, Helium, SourceMogul, ZonGuru, Keepa,
    AMZScout, and many others. However, third-party tools can only work if the platform
    provides them with the APIs to access frontier knowledge.
    Boundary Resources and Innovation Toolkits
    Building an app for iOS or Android from scratch is a daunting undertaking, even for
    experienced developers. Without proper development tools and guidelines, creators
    face overwhelming technical hurdles: managing complex device permissions, han­
    dling different screen sizes and hardware capabilities, ensuring security compliance,
    implementing stable background processes, and maintaining compatibility across
    multiple OS versions. A simple mistake in any of these areas can lead to crashes, secu­
    rity vulnerabilities, or rejection from the app store. This complexity explains why
    platforms must provide sophisticated development infrastructure to enable innova­
    tion at scale.
    At the heart of this infrastructure are what scholars call “boundary resources” –
    the interfaces and tools that enable external parties to build on top of the platform
    (Eaton et al., 2015; Ghazawneh & Henfridsson, 2013). The most basic form of these are
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs).
    APIs provide structured ways to interact with the platform’s core functionality, while
    SDKs offer pre-built components, testing tools, and implementation examples. To­
    gether, these resources dramatically reduce the technical barriers to innovation. For
    example, rather than having to understand the intricacies of GPS hardware access,
    location permissions, and background tracking, a developer can use Google Maps’
    SDK to add location features to their app with just a few lines of code.
    While powerful, these developer-focused tools reach only a small fraction of po­
    tential innovators. Platforms achieve broader impact by making their capabilities ac­
    cessible to the general population. If the platform itself does not provide the right
    boundary resources, there will be an arbitrage opportunity for others to step in and
    create those resources. This has occurred very notably with no-code app development
    platforms that allow non-developers to build Android and iOS apps.
    Consider OpenAI’s journey: The company was initially only developer-focused
    and offered APIs that thousands of developers used to build AI-powered applications.
    The introduction of custom GPTs in 2023 marked an attempt to recognize and wel­
    come non-developers as innovators in the OpenAI ecosystem. Anyone could customize
    and extend ChatGPT’s capabilities through a no-code interface for building custom
    GPTs, without programming knowledge. However, the company initially fell short of
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale 93
    providing the IP protection and monetization capabilities needed for those innovators
    to be able to pursue serious profit opportunities. Taking non-developer user-innova­
    tors seriously as entrepreneurs is no trivial matter.
    The concept of boundary resources aligns with the notion of “innovation toolkits”
    in the user innovation literature (Thomke & Von Hippel, 2002; Von Hippel, 2001).
    Well-designed innovation toolkits have been described as having four essential ele­
    ments:
35. They enable complete cycles of trial-and-error learning: Users need to be able to
    rapidly experiment with all the tools they need from design and prototyping to
    production and monetization.
36. They offer user-friendly interfaces: The toolkit should allow users to work in the
    ways that make sense to them, rather than forcing them to learn technical re­
    quirements or programming.
37. They include libraries of commonly used components: By providing pre-tested
    modules, users can focus their creative efforts on the truly novel aspects of their
    designs.
38. They steer user innovations through production constraints: The toolkit must en­
    sure that user designs can be produced on the platform without requiring signifi­
    cant rework to make them compatible afterwards.
    As a highly generative platform with a highly generative marketplace, Roblox pro­
    vides one of the most successful examples of making innovation toolkits accessible to
    non-developers, especially young creators. Their Roblox Studio platform offers a com­
    prehensive environment that perfectly illustrates the four elements of well-designed
    innovation toolkits:
39. Users can rapidly prototype games and game elements with real-time feedback
    and testing.
40. The interface allows for visual scripting and intuitive building blocks that do not
    require traditional coding knowledge. Recent AI features make it even easier to
    build from text prompts.
41. The platform provides an extensive library of pre-built assets, models, and game
    mechanics.
42. Built-in constraints ensure games will run properly on all supported devices.
    Most importantly, Roblox takes its user-innovators seriously as entrepreneurs. The
    platform has enabled many non-technical and young creators to build sustainable
    businesses, with some top developers earning millions annually. They’ve created
    easy-to-use building tools, proper monetization infrastructure, robust IP protection,
    and analytics tools to help creators understand and grow their audience. This has re­
    sulted in a thriving ecosystem that shows consistent growth year after year.
    94 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    Standards and Interoperability
    Standards play a somewhat dual role in enabling a dynamic ecosystem of innovations.
    While at first glance we might associate the idea of standards with an inhibition of
    innovation, resistance to change, and creating barriers to entry, in reality standards
    also play an important enabling role in spurring the dynamics of innovation at scale
    (Allen & Sriram, 2000; Blind, 2016). In fact, boundary resources such as APIs and SDKS
    play an important standardization role by constraining user innovations to certain
    standards that make them compatible with the platform.
    Standards serve multiple crucial functions that enable distributed innovation:
    – Ensuring Interoperability: Standards ensure that different innovations can
    work together reliably. This is a foundational aspect, as without interoperability,
    the value of individual innovations diminishes in a platform ecosystem. Interop­
    erability is key to achieving network effects and avoiding lock-in to old technolo­
    gies (Blind, 2016). Compatibility standards are crucial for the development of an
    industry by ensuring seamless connections between products and facilitating the
    diffusion of innovative products (Zoo et al., 2017).
    – Reducing Complexity: Standards reduce unnecessary complexity by handling
    common technical challenges. This allows innovators to focus on unique aspects
    of their contributions, rather than having to solve basic compatibility issues
    every time. This is achieved by defining common vocabularies, setting essential
    characteristics for products or services, and detecting best practices within eco­
    systems (Shin et al., 2015).
    – Creating Predictability: Standards create predictable behaviors that users and
    other innovators can rely on. This predictability reduces uncertainty and risk, en­
    couraging more participation and investment in the ecosystem. By reducing un­
    certainty and risks associated with new products, minimum quality standards, in
    particular, build consumer trust (Zoo et al., 2017).
    – Enabling Horizontal Complementarity: Standards also enable horizontal com­
    plementarity, where different innovations can enhance each other’s value. In
    platform ecosystems, this can be understood as the value-creating relationships
    between complements on a platform, such as an email and calendar application,
    in which standards can play a role in enabling the interoperability (Thomas et al.,
    2024). This kind of combinatorial innovation is central to the generative capacity
    of platforms.
    Zoo et al. (2017) provide a useful taxonomy of standards and their effects on inno­
    vation:
43. Variety Reduction Standards: These standards, by defining specifications of
    products and services, help firms achieve economies of scale and critical mass.
44. Minimum Quality Standards: These standards reduce uncertainty and risks by
    establishing a baseline level of quality.
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale 95
45. Compatibility Standards: These standards are central to achieving network ef­
    fects and avoiding lock-ins, allowing different products and services to work to­
    gether.
46. Information Standards: These provide a common understanding of technologi­
    cal knowledge, reducing transaction costs and facilitating trade.
    In summary, standards and interoperability are the bedrock of generative platforms,
    enabling distributed innovation by providing a common language, reducing complex­
    ity, and fostering predictability. However, they must be carefully managed to avoid
    stifling innovation, creating market concentration, or excluding certain participants.
    Enabling Organization: The Power of Teams and Organizations in User Innovation
    While individual creators can produce remarkable innovations, the most complex
    and valuable contributions often come from organized teams working together. As in­
    novations become more complex, they often require diverse skills and resources that
    a single user may not possess. Organization allows for specialization, division of
    labor, and the combination of diverse skills needed to tackle sophisticated challenges.
    For example, developing a sophisticated commercially viable product may require ex­
    pertise in design, engineering, marketing, finance, and legal aspects, which are diffi­
    cult for an individual to manage effectively. Smart platform companies recognize this
    reality and build infrastructure to support not just individual innovators but the for­
    mation and operation of organizations within their ecosystems. They understand that
    the highest-value activities in their marketplace – whether developing enterprise-
    grade software applications, creating comprehensive educational content, or building
    sophisticated business solutions – are likely to require coordinated effort from multi­
    ple contributors. It is crucial here that we are not just talking about enterprise fea­
    tures for large organizations: we are talking about features that enable innovators in
    the ecosystem to organize, form companies around the value they can create in your
    ecosystem, and grow.
    This dynamic can be seen with many Bubble.io users who have turned their Bub­
    ble-made software into viable businesses, and are now managing companies with
    multiple team members. Bubble provides Team and Enterprise features with special­
    ized pricing for such cases. Similarly, the most successful creators on Roblox aren’t
    individual developers but small game studios that have emerged within the platform’s
    ecosystem. Roblox actively supports this evolution by providing team features and
    collaboration tools in Roblox Studio.
    Platforms that take their user-innovators seriously as entrepreneurs must recog­
    nize that high-quality innovations frequently require professional teams and organi­
    zational infrastructure. However, platforms should be strategic about where they in­
    vest in building support tools – focusing only on areas where they can provide unique
    96 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    value through their data and ecosystem-specific resources. You don’t want to reinvent
    the wheel: there are already lots of third-party tools to help people manage a startup
    or small business. But those tools don’t always integrate with your platform in the
    ways that your user-innovators need.
    For example, while general project management software and CRM systems are
    readily available, platforms can offer specialized capabilities that generic tools cannot
    match. A well-designed platform might provide:
    – Team Formation Tools: The platform can leverage its unique understanding of
    user activity patterns, skill profiles, and project histories to create powerful
    matching systems that connect complementary innovators. Unlike generic profes­
    sional networks, these recommendations can be based on actual platform-specific
    experience and demonstrated capabilities.
    – Resource Coordination: While teams may use external tools for basic project man­
    agement, the platform can integrate deeply with its innovation toolkits to enable
    real-time collaboration. This might include shared workspaces tied directly to the
    platform’s development environment, version control systems optimized for the
    platform’s tools, and resource allocation mechanisms that understand the plat­
    form’s unique constraints.
    – Organization-Level Analytics: The platform has unique access to data about how
    teams use its tools, interact with customers, and deploy resources. By analyzing
    this data, platforms can provide teams with insights about their performance, re­
    source utilization, and growth opportunities that would be impossible to get from
    generic analytics tools.
    Consider how Shopify approaches this challenge. While their platform supports indi­
    vidual developers, they have built extensive infrastructure for agencies and develop­
    ment firms. Their Partner Program includes specialized tools for team collaboration,
    project management, and client relationship handling. This has enabled the emer­
    gence of sophisticated Shopify-focused development agencies that can tackle complex
    projects for major retailers – projects that would be impossible for individual devel­
    opers to handle alone.
    Getting this right is not easy. In our study of the Bubble no-code platform ecosys­
    tem we found that many of the most popular and sophisticated Bubble plugins aren’t
    built by lone developers but by small companies that have formed specifically to de­
    velop and maintain these tools. They even actively engage in strategic acquisitions of
    plugins built by others. While Bubble has some support mechanisms for these organ­
    izations, most Bubble plugin developers that we interviewed said that the platform
    still has much room for improvement in providing developer tools and support
    systems.
    The support for organization formation creates a powerful feedback cycle: As
    platforms make it easier for teams to form and operate effectively, more complex and
    valuable innovations become possible. These successes attract more talented individ
    The Generation Layer: Spurring Innovation at Scale 97
    uals to the platform, who in turn form new organizations to tackle even more ambi­
    tious projects.
    This organizational support becomes particularly crucial as platforms mature.
    While early innovations might come from individual creators, sustained growth often
    depends on enabling more sophisticated organizational structures that can tackle in­
    creasingly complex challenges. Platforms that recognize and support this evolution
    are more likely to maintain their generative potential over time.
    Enabling user innovators to form organizations has other ancillary benefits as
    well. When users see that other users are able to build profitable businesses with
    your platform and form professional organizations around those businesses, this is a
    strong signal that the value creation system is rich enough to allow such activities,
    and reliable enough to make it a safe-enough bet. Users who are shaping businesses
    around their innovations with your platform are signaling to the world that they are
    willing to put skin in your game, and that it is an ecosystem ripe with opportunity.
    Engineering Markets for Generativity
    In this section on the generation layer of generative marketplaces we have discussed
    the orchestrating of diversity, interaction, experimentation, and infrastructure, such
    that distributed creativity can flourish in ways that centralized innovation efforts
    could never achieve.
    What makes the generation layer particularly powerful is the way its elements
    reinforce one another. Diversity of participants and ideas expands the space of possi­
    ble innovations, while structured serendipity fosters unexpected connections that
    lead to breakthroughs. Robust experimentation systems capture insights from both
    successes and failures, broadcasting these learnings across the ecosystem to acceler­
    ate collective progress. Knowledge-sharing infrastructure ensures that the accumu­
    lated wisdom of the community remains accessible, usable, and continuously refined.
    Standards and protocols provide the coherence needed for innovations to build upon
    each other without stifling creativity. Organization-enabling tools allow small teams
    to scale their impact and tackle increasingly complex challenges.
    At its core, the generation layer embraces outliers and unconventional ideas, rec­
    ognizing that the most transformative innovations often emerge from the fringes.
    Platforms that celebrate intellectual diversity and encourage dissent, build systems
    that disrupt echo chambers and challenge groupthink, enabling paradigm shifts that
    redefine entire industries. Similarly, by harnessing their privileged position and ac­
    cess to ecosystem data, platforms can act as curators of frontier knowledge, systemati­
    cally broadcasting insights that help their communities innovate faster and smarter.
    Perhaps most importantly, the generation layer fundamentally redefines the role
    of platform companies. Rather than attempting to predict or control innovation from
    the center, these platforms focus on engineering the conditions that allow innovation
    98 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    to emerge from anywhere. They build environments that combine structure with
    openness, empowering participants to create, collaborate, iterate, and build upon
    each other’s ideas. This approach transforms platforms into engines of generativity,
    where innovation is no longer a byproduct but a deliberate, scalable outcome.
    The most valuable innovations come from unexpected combinations of ideas, ca­
    pabilities, and perspectives that no central planner could have anticipated. The gener­
    ation layer explicitly architects for this kind of generativity, unlocking new possibil­
    ities.
    The Appropriation Layer: Capturing Value from Distributed
    Innovation
    While the generation layer enables innovation and the allocation layer facilitates effi­
    cient matching, the appropriation layer determines how platform owners can sustain­
    ably capture value from the distributed creativity they enable. This is perhaps the
    most delicate balancing act in designing generative marketplaces. The challenge is to
    avoid an exploitative mindset and think about a fair distribution of value that nur­
    tures rather than stifles the ecosystem of innovators and the generative potential of
    the platform.
    The literature on multi-sided markets has established that platform business
    models often defy traditional strategic logic (Rysman, 2009). For instance, it can be
    optimal to price below marginal cost on one side of the market to generate positive
    spillover effects on the other side (Rochet & Tirole, 2006). However, most existing re­
    search on value capture in platform markets focuses primarily on allocative efficiency
    rather than generativity. This creates a significant gap in our understanding, as mech­
    anisms designed to extract value from allocative markets may have unintended nega­
    tive effects on generative capacity.
    In this section we discuss some ideas for appropriation mechanisms that support
    market generativity (see Table 7.3 for a summary).
    Innovation-Friendly Pricing and Revenue Models in Generative Marketplaces
    The pricing and revenue models a platform adopts fundamentally shape how partici­
    pants engage with it. Traditional pricing approaches often create barriers that dis­
    courage experimentation, pushing participants toward safer, more predictable activi­
    ties. But thoughtfully designed revenue models can do the opposite – reducing risk,
    encouraging bold experiments, and creating conditions where breakthrough innova­
    tions are more likely to emerge. Several key principles help design innovation-
    friendly pricing and revenue models:

    Reducing Barriers to Entry and Aligning Incentives
    High upfront costs discourage experimentation by steering participants toward
    proven, less risky ideas. Successful platforms employ various strategies to lower these
    barriers. This often involves designing pricing models that align their financial suc­
    cess with that of their participants, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship.
    – Revenue Sharing: By adopting revenue-sharing structures, platforms allow par­
    ticipants to avoid upfront costs and instead pay a percentage of their earnings.
    Stripe is free to use and build with, but will charge a fee per transaction. Simi­
    larly, platforms like Etsy provide a low-cost entry for artisans, enabling them to
    experiment with unique product ideas without significant initial investment.
    – Freemium or Tiered Models: Offering free entry-level access allows participants
    to explore and test their ideas without financial commitment. LinkedIn’s free tier
    attracts millions of users, enabling them to develop their networks, while moneti­
    zation occurs through premium subscriptions and targeted advertising. This dual
    102 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    structure creates a pipeline of users who might eventually transition to paid fea­
    tures. GitHub further demonstrates this approach through free public reposito­
    ries, empowering developers to collaborate and innovate with a low-risk entry
    point, while monetizing through advanced enterprise tools. Freemium models en­
    courage innovation best when the free tier is good enough for innovators to
    make significant progress. If too many of the tools they need are in paid or expen­
    sive pricing tiers, this is not a very entrepreneur-friendly freemium model. The
    Tally.so form-builder software provides an example of an entrepreneur-friendly
    freemium model, where almost all product features are in the free tier, and only
    a few features important for entrepreneurs who have already reached profitabil­
    ity are in premium pricing tiers.
    – Pay-as-You-Go: Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) pay-as-you-go structure supports
    innovation by allowing startups and individuals to scale usage and costs incre­
    mentally, directly linking resource consumption to value. This model enables a
    kind of “gradual innovation” where participants can start small, experiment
    cheaply, and scale up only when they find success. Importantly, if pay-as-you-go
    options are not available, innovators may have trouble scaling. Replit.com’s AI
    agent for programming initially only allowed a limited number of credits based
    on your monthly subscription but soon realized that users were demanding to be
    able to pay to use the product beyond their monthly quotas if they needed to.
    Leveraging Cross-Subsidization
    Platforms often subsidize certain user groups or activities to drive overall ecosystem
    growth, recouping costs from complementary revenue streams.
    – Ad-Supported Services: Google offers free search services, funded through ad­
    vertising revenue. This model attracts billions of users, creating a rich data eco­
    system that fuels advertising innovation. By lowering user costs, platforms can
    rapidly scale participation while monetizing other aspects of their ecosystem.
    – Freemium to Premium Upgrades: Spotify entices users with free access while
    generating revenue through premium subscriptions. This strategy ensures wide­
    spread adoption while catering to high-value customers who demand enhanced
    features. The free tier creates value for artists by building audience reach, which
    the platform can then monetize through premium subscriptions and advertising.
    Ensuring Perceived Fairness and Trust
    Trust and fairness in pricing models are pivotal for encouraging sustained engage­
    ment and innovation within the marketplace.
    – Transparent Fee Structures: Platforms like Etsy are known for clearly commu­
    nicating their transaction fees, which fosters a sense of fairness and reduces user
    apprehension. Transparent pricing helps ensure that contributors feel valued and
    not exploited.
    The Appropriation Layer: Capturing Value from Distributed Innovation 103
    – Equitable Revenue Sharing: Fair revenue-sharing agreements are essential for
    maintaining participant trust. Airbnb’s model, where hosts pay a percentage of
    their earnings, is seen as equitable because fees scale with participant success.
    This proportionality ensures that contributors retain significant rewards from
    their innovation efforts.
    These principles suggest several key strategic considerations for platform leaders:
47. Focus on reducing the cost of failure rather than just rewarding success.
48. Align platform revenue with participant success through revenue sharing.
49. Use free tiers strategically to encourage experimentation and learning.
50. Consider dynamic pricing that scales with value creation.
51. Employ cross-subsidization to build critical mass in key areas.
52. Maintain transparency to build long-term trust.
    The ultimate goal is to create revenue models that capture enough value to sustain the
    platform while minimizing barriers to experimentation and creativity. Getting this bal­
    ance right is crucial because it shapes not just individual transactions but the overall
    generative potential of the marketplace.
    However, the specific structure of these models matters enormously. If the plat­
    form’s take is too high, it can still discourage innovation by making it difficult for par­
    ticipants to achieve profitability. Apple and Google’s famous ~30% commission fees on
    apps in their mobile app stores has faced growing criticism from developers who
    argue it makes many business models unsustainable. The key is finding rates that
    allow the platform to capture enough value to sustain its operations while leaving
    participants with sufficient margin to justify continued innovation.
    Control Points and Value Capture
    The concept of control points emerged from MIT’s Value Chain Dynamics Working
    Group (Trossen & Fine, 2005) as researchers grappled with a fundamental question:
    How can firms sustainably capture value in rapidly evolving digital industries? Con­
    trol points refer to “functional areas in a value chain or network where power can be
    exercised” (Eaton et al., 2010, p. 462). Bohnsack et al. (2024, p. 6) expand the definition
    of control points to emphasize value capture relative to competitors but with a broad­
    ened scope of domains in which they could appear: “a technical or strategic feature in
    a digital business ecosystem – such as customer access, a unique solution, or an or­
    chestration position – that competitors must navigate, thereby significantly decreas­
    ing their bargaining power.” Importantly, power and influence can be exercised to
    steer innovation and profitability, and thinking innovation-first (expanding the pie) is
    not always fully aligned with thinking profit-first (taking a larger piece of the pie).
    104 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    Bohnsack et al. (2024) identify three distinct categories of control points that shape
    value creation and capture in digital ecosystems:
53. Technical control points emerge from the platform’s technical features – things
    like APIs, data access, and technical infrastructure that enable or constrain what
    innovations are possible. These primarily determine value creation potential.
54. Strategic control points like brand strength, customer relationships, and orches­
    tration capabilities shape how much value can be captured. Unlike technical con­
    trol points which can be relatively fluid, strategic control points tend to be more
    durable sources of advantage.
55. Generic control points, particularly modularity and scalability, are table stakes
    that all ecosystem participants must participate in meaningfully. These enable the
    basic generative potential of the platform.
    Bohnsack et al. describe a “seesaw pattern” where organizations must balance ex­
    ploiting established control points while developing new ones. This pattern is visible
    in generative platforms:
56. Technical to Strategic: New platforms often start with strong technical control
    points but must develop strategic ones to ensure sustainable value capture. Bub­
    ble’s journey from technical innovation in visual programming that allowed them
    to gain popularity among indie entrepreneurs to gaining recognition as the mar­
    ket leader in no-code/low-code and building enterprise relationships exemplifies
    this pattern.
57. Strategic to Technical: Established companies entering platform markets must
    translate strategic control points (brand, relationships) into technical ones. Micro­
    soft’s Power Platform journey exemplifies this pattern – they leveraged their ex­
    isting strategic control points (enterprise relationships, Office ecosystem, Azure
    cloud infrastructure) to enter the no-code/low-code space but had to develop new
    technical control points around visual development, workflow automation, and
    citizen development to compete effectively.
    A Staged Approach to Control Points
    The evolution of control points in digital ecosystems is not a one-time event but a dy­
    namic, staged process. Firms seeking to balance innovation with value capture must
    carefully navigate the shifting landscape of control points, ensuring that they maintain
    relevance and competitive advantage as their ecosystems mature. Bohnsack et al.’s
    framework suggests a four-stage progression that platform leaders can follow to strate­
    gically develop and sustain control points over time.
    Stage 1 – Establishing Generic Control Points: At the foundational level, every digi­
    tal platform must first secure basic structural capabilities that enable ecosystem par­
    ticipation. These generic control points do not differentiate a firm but serve as neces
    The Appropriation Layer: Capturing Value from Distributed Innovation 105
    sary prerequisites for growth and engagement. Two key priorities at this stage are
    modularity and scalability. Modularity ensures that platform components can be flex­
    ibly combined and extended, fostering innovation by allowing third-party developers
    to build upon the core system. Scalability, on the other hand, ensures that the plat­
    form can handle growth without performance bottlenecks. Additionally, firms must
    establish well-defined interfaces—such as APIs or developer tools—that facilitate eco­
    system participation. Without these generic control points in place, a platform lacks
    the fundamental infrastructure needed to generate sustained value.
    Stage 2 – Developing Technical Control Points: Once the foundation is established,
    firms must shift their focus toward technical control points—distinctive technological
    capabilities that create value while preserving control. Unlike generic control points,
    technical ones introduce differentiation, making a platform more attractive relative
    to competitors. This stage involves the strategic deployment of APIs, development
    tools, and data access mechanisms that not only enable third-party innovation but
    also reinforce the platform’s influence. Additionally, technical infrastructure must be
    built to support ecosystem expansion, ensuring reliability and security as the network
    scales. Firms at this stage also set the technical standards and protocols that define
    the rules of engagement for ecosystem participants. By controlling the underlying ar­
    chitecture, they shape how value is created and distributed, influencing the direction
    of innovation.
    Stage 3 – Establishing Strategic Control Points: Technical control points alone, how­
    ever, are rarely sufficient for long-term value capture. As ecosystems mature, firms
    must transition from merely enabling innovation to strategically orchestrating it. This
    involves building strong customer relationships, deep industry expertise, and brand
    positioning—elements that competitors cannot easily replicate. At this stage, network
    effects become critical. Firms must actively strengthen their position by fostering user
    interdependencies, ecosystem loyalty, and strategic alliances. Control shifts from the
    technical infrastructure itself to the ability to orchestrate participants and shape mar­
    ket dynamics. A strong brand, for instance, can serve as a durable strategic control
    point, ensuring continued influence even as technology evolves.
    Stage 4 – Maintaining Dynamic Balance: The final stage is not a static endpoint but
    an ongoing process of adaptation. Control points are not fixed assets; they must be
    continuously refined and recalibrated in response to market shifts, competitive pres­
    sures, and technological advancements. Firms must monitor ecosystem evolution,
    identifying emerging threats and opportunities that require adjustments to their con­
    trol strategy. Some control points may need reinforcement, while others must be re­
    laxed to encourage broader ecosystem participation. Striking the right balance be­
    tween technical control (which fosters innovation) and strategic control (which
    ensures value capture) is crucial. Firms that over-index on technical openness may
    106 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    struggle to monetize their platforms, while those that tighten control too aggressively
    may stifle innovation and alienate partners.
    The Data Advantage
    One of the most compelling value capture mechanisms in marketplaces stems from
    the platform owner’s unique ability to aggregate, analyze, and deploy data. Platforms
    accumulate vast amounts of data from interactions, transactions, and user behaviors,
    transforming these digital footprints into actionable insights. Furthermore, this kind
    of value capture is usually a win-win outcome for everyone, because the insights pro­
    duced are valuable for all ecosystem participants but could not have been achieved if
    not for aggregation at the platform level. Over time, this process creates a self-
    reinforcing cycle: more participants generate more data, which leads to better in­
    sights and improved functionality, attracting even more participants.
    This data advantage can lead to a powerful competitive moat for the platform.
    This advantage is sometimes referred to as “data rents” (Komljenovic, 2021) and in­
    volves “assetization” of data, the process where platforms derive long-term value
    from information flows by transforming raw data into enduring strategic assets.
    While this enhances the user experience, it also consolidates market power by creat­
    ing barriers for competitors who lack comparable datasets. When deployed strategi­
    cally, the data advantage can stimulate distributed innovation by providing ecosystem
    participants with valuable insights that fuel creativity and experimentation.
    Platforms like YouTube exemplify the power of this mechanism. By analyzing
    viewing patterns and engagement behaviors across billions of users, YouTube gains
    unique insights into content preferences. These insights inform not only its recom­
    mendation algorithms but also empower creators to innovate by providing detailed
    analytics on audience engagement and preferences. This collaborative feedback loop
    strengthens the generative ecosystem by helping creators optimize their content, ex­
    periment with new formats, and align their innovations with audience needs. You­
    Tube’s ability to share data-driven insights fosters distributed innovation, making the
    platform indispensable for both creators and viewers.
    Another obvious benefit of data aggregation is the enabling of targeted advertis­
    ing. Platforms can efficiently match sellers with consumers by using precise data to
    target advertisements. Platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and Amazon rely on
    such strategies to optimize the relevance of offerings. By steering consumers toward
    specific products or services, platforms not only drive higher engagement but also
    create opportunities for distributed innovation. For example, smaller sellers can le­
    verage these insights to refine their offerings and tailor their innovations to meet the
    precise needs of niche audiences, thus reinforcing the generativity of the market­
    place.
    The Appropriation Layer: Capturing Value from Distributed Innovation 107
    Yet this dominance comes with trade-offs. The ability to steer consumer behavior
    introduces significant power asymmetries between platforms, sellers, and users. As
    Bergemann and Bonatti (2024) point out, the controlled environment of a platform
    often restricts sellers’ competitive flexibility while simultaneously increasing their de­
    pendency. Sellers face a “showrooming constraint”—they must provide competitive
    off-platform offers to retain consumers who might otherwise use the platform as a
    discovery tool but purchase elsewhere. This dynamic underscores a critical tension in
    leveraging the data advantage: balancing appropriation and generativity. Platforms
    that manage this balance well can encourage ecosystem participants to innovate
    more freely, knowing they will benefit from the marketplace’s broader data-driven in­
    sights.
    Santesteban and Longpré (2020) provide further clarity on the mechanics of data-
    driven market power. They emphasize that economies of scale and scope in data ag­
    gregation create increasing returns, making it nearly impossible for smaller players
    to compete effectively. Platforms achieve a compounding advantage as their data
    troves grow, enabling them to refine algorithms, predict consumer behavior, and opti­
    mize resource allocation. However, they also highlight a potential pitfall: platforms
    that excessively hoard data risk undermining trust and generativity within the eco­
    system.
    Fast et al. (2023) argue that the scale of data control by platforms like Amazon
    and Google can entrench monopolistic tendencies. Their analysis underscores the im­
    portance of privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as federated learning, which bal­
    ance the use of data for competitive advantage with consumer trust and regulatory
    compliance. This perspective aligns with Bergemann and Bonatti’s (2024) findings on
    privacy governance, which suggest that cohort-based advertising—where platforms
    share aggregated rather than individual data—can enhance consumer surplus with­
    out diminishing the platform’s ability to create value. By enabling distributed innova­
    tion through privacy-preserving data sharing, generative marketplaces can maintain
    both ecosystem trust and long-term innovation. To fully harness the data advantage,
    generative marketplaces must navigate the fine line between value creation and over­
    reach.
    Curation and Promotion as Strategic Levers
    Platforms wield significant influence through their ability to curate and promote con­
    tent within their marketplaces. This influence extends beyond simply surfacing “best
    in class” offerings – it serves as a strategic tool for managing the overall health and
    value of the platform ecosystem. As Rietveld et al. (2019) demonstrate in their study of
    video game platforms, promotion decisions involve careful orchestration of multiple
    competing priorities, such as:
    108 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
58. Unrealized Potential vs. Established Success: Rather than simply promoting
    the highest-performing complements, platforms often focus on “up and coming”
    offerings that show promise but have not yet reached their full potential. This ap­
    proach allows platforms to help surface hidden gems and create new stars rather
    than just amplifying existing successes. For example, mobile app stores may fea­
    ture promising new apps alongside established favorites to help users discover
    emerging innovations. Notion’s template gallery exemplifies this approach, prom­
    inently featuring innovative new use cases alongside popular templates to help
    users discover emerging workflow innovations.
59. Portfolio Balance and Ecosystem Gaps: Platforms strategically promote content
    to ensure breadth and depth across different categories. If a platform lacks strong
    offerings in an important category, it may invest extra promotional effort there
    to help strengthen that part of the ecosystem. This portfolio-level thinking helps
    platforms maintain comprehensive value propositions for users. Stripe’s app mar­
    ketplace demonstrates this balance, carefully curating a mix of established finan­
    cial tools and innovative new fintech solutions to ensure their platform serves
    the full spectrum of modern payment and financial needs.
60. Timing and Competitive Dynamics: Promotion timing can be used strategically
    to boost engagement during slow periods and manage competitive dynamics be­
    tween complements. Platforms must consider not just which complements to pro­
    mote but when to promote them to maximize overall ecosystem value. Webflow’s
    showcase strategically times its promotion of both established agencies and
    breakthrough designers to maintain steady engagement and inspire different seg­
    ments of their community throughout the year.
61. Quality Signals and Innovation: While quality remains a key consideration,
    platforms look beyond simple metrics to identify truly innovative contributions
    that advance the state of the art. This helps maintain the platform’s competitive
    position while rewarding genuine innovation. Shopify’s app collection process
    exemplifies this balance, combining transparent quality criteria with strategic cu­
    ration to surface truly innovative solutions that expand the platform’s capabil­
    ities.
62. Platform Loyalty and Strategic Alignment: Platforms often use promotion to
    reward and incentivize loyalty from key complement producers. However, this
    must be balanced against maintaining credible, merit-based promotion criteria
    that developers trust. For example, while Shopify promotes established app devel­
    opers who have demonstrated long-term commitment to the platform, they main­
    tain clear paths for new innovators to earn promotion through exceptional qual­
    ity and innovation.
    The power to promote represents both an opportunity and a responsibility for plat­
    form sponsors. While they naturally want to use promotion to strengthen their com
    The Appropriation Layer: Capturing Value from Distributed Innovation 109
    petitive position, they must avoid creating perverse incentives that could discourage
    innovation or erode trust. Several key tensions must be balanced:
    – Supporting established partners versus surfacing new innovators
    – Promoting proven successes versus betting on promising newcomers
    – Meeting immediate business needs versus long-term ecosystem health
    – Using promotion as a strategic lever versus maintaining fair, transparent criteria
    The balancing act in practice could take on various forms:
    – Establishing clear, merit-based criteria for promotion while maintaining some
    flexibility for strategic considerations
    – Using promotion thoughtfully to shape ecosystem development while avoiding
    heavy-handed manipulation
    – Balancing support for established partners with opportunities for emerging inno­
    vators
    – Considering both individual complement success and overall portfolio health in
    promotion decisions
    For generative platforms specifically, promotion strategy should align with the goal of
    encouraging unpredicted innovation at scale. This means maintaining genuinely open
    pathways for new innovations to gain visibility while still leveraging promotion stra­
    tegically to strengthen the platform’s position.
    Ethical Considerations in Profiting from Other People’s Innovations
    Profiting from the innovations of others on a generative platform is not without ethi­
    cal complexities. Each innovator has a strong sense of ownership over their creations,
    and sometimes there can be unresolvable differences of opinion around how much of
    a claim to contribution the innovator has compared to the platform that made the
    innovation possible. Ethical challenges for generative platforms revolve around fair­
    ness, transparency, and the balance of power between the platform and its contribu­
    tors. Below are the key ethical challenges and potential solutions, illustrated with
    real-world examples of platforms that have faced similar dilemmas.
63. Balancing Value Capture and Fairness: Platforms must ensure that their reve­
    nue models equitably share the value generated by participant innovations. Ex­
    ploitative practices—such as high commission rates or monopolistic behavior—
    can erode trust and discourage participation. For instance, criticisms of Amazon’s
    Marketplace have included claims that the platform’s fee structures dispropor­
    tionately benefit Amazon while limiting small sellers’ profitability. To address
    such issues, platforms can adopt revenue-sharing schemes that are transparent
    and proportional, ensuring contributors retain significant rewards for their inno­
    vations.
    110 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
64. Maintaining Transparency: Opaque fee structures or hidden costs can lead to
    perceptions of exploitation and mistrust among participants. Transparent com­
    munication about pricing models is essential. Airbnb’s approach to clearly itemiz­
    ing service fees—including a breakdown of what hosts and guests pay—has been
    a step in the right direction, fostering trust and encouraging continued en­
    gagement.
65. Addressing Power Asymmetries: The concentration of decision-making power in
    platforms can lead to ethical dilemmas, particularly when platforms unilaterally
    change policies that affect contributors. For example, Etsy’s decision to increase
    seller fees sparked backlash, as many felt the changes were imposed without suf­
    ficient consultation. To mitigate such issues, platforms could adopt governance
    models that involve contributors in decision-making processes, ensuring their
    voices are heard in policy shifts.
66. Fostering Inclusive Participation: Smaller contributors often face significant
    barriers to participation, particularly if pricing models disproportionately burden
    them. Google’s strategy of offering free tools while monetizing through advertis­
    ing ensures that even small-scale innovators can engage without upfront costs.
    This inclusivity broadens participation and fosters a diverse innovation eco­
    system.
67. Encouraging Ethical Data Practices: Platforms profiting from user data must
    navigate ethical challenges surrounding privacy and consent. Stemler et al. (2020)
    emphasize the importance of transparency in data usage and suggest adopting ex­
    plicit user agreements (a “Code of the Platform”) that clarifies how data is mone­
    tized and how the platform mediates transactions. Such practices help platforms
    maintain ethical standards while capturing value from user contributions.
    Capturing Value while Spurring Innovation
    The appropriation layer must balance the dual imperatives of sustaining the plat­
    form’s operations and nurturing the creativity that fuels its ecosystem. A well-
    designed appropriation layer achieves this by combining thoughtful revenue models,
    strategic control points, and participant-focused mechanisms.
    The appropriation layer’s success depends on innovation-friendly pricing models.
    These include revenue-sharing arrangements that lower upfront costs, freemium tiers
    that encourage broad participation, and dynamic pricing structures that scale with
    user success. These strategies reduce barriers to entry and incentivize experimenta­
    tion, creating a vibrant environment for innovation.
    Equally important are the mechanisms that sustain long-term engagement and re­
    inforce platform ecosystems. Lock-in effects, such as proprietary tools and data ad­
    vantages, ensure participants remain committed by offering unique value proposi­
    tions. Switching costs, whether technical or relational, further solidify participant
    External Factors: The Broader Context of Generative Markets 111
    loyalty by embedding their success within the platform’s ecosystem. However, these
    mechanisms must be employed judiciously. Over-reliance on restrictive practices
    risks stifling the very generativity the platform seeks to promote.
    Many users of the Bubble no-code development platform worry about lock-in and
    switching costs, and consider these issues before deciding to invest heavily in building
    with the platform. Since many users do eventually get locked in and face high switch­
    ing costs, various Bubble developers and Bubble plugin developers benefit from hav­
    ing a thick market of such users. But if the platform is too aggressive about its lock-in
    practices, it will discourage many users from joining in the first place.
    Strategic control points play a pivotal role in capturing value without undermin­
    ing generativity. Platforms like Apple’s App Store or Google Maps leverage technical
    and strategic control points to steer innovation while maintaining profitability. These
    points—from APIs to branding—enable platforms to foster distributed creativity
    while ensuring they benefit from the innovations they enable.
    The appropriation layer is also enriched by the platform’s ability to harness net­
    work effects and data advantages. As participation grows, the ecosystem becomes in­
    creasingly valuable, reinforcing its attractiveness to new and existing participants.
    Platforms that effectively analyze and share data-driven insights empower partici­
    pants to innovate in ways that align with user needs, deepening engagement and sus­
    taining growth.
    Ultimately, the appropriation layer’s objective is not only to capture value but to
    do so in a manner that creates a self-reinforcing cycle of innovation and engagement.
    By aligning platform success with participant success, leveraging strategic mecha­
    nisms like lock-in and switching costs thoughtfully, and maintaining trust through
    transparency and fairness, generative marketplaces can unlock their full potential.
    The appropriation layer, when designed with care and foresight, transforms distrib­
    uted creativity into sustainable competitive advantage.
    External Factors: The Broader Context of Generative Markets
    While we have focused on the internal architecture of generative marketplaces
    through our three-layered model, these markets don’t exist in isolation. They operate
    within broader economic, social, and institutional contexts that profoundly shape
    their potential for generativity. Understanding these external factors is crucial be­
    cause they can either amplify or constrain a marketplace’s generative capacity.
    Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps (2013) identifies four critical categories of enabling
    conditions that determine an economy’s capacity for generativity:
68. Economic Institutions: The fundamental frameworks of property rights, financial
    markets, and inclusive participation
69. Political Institutions: Representative systems that ensure stable and predictable
    governance
    112 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
70. Cultural Elements: Societal attitudes toward innovation, entrepreneurship, and
    change
71. Demographic Factors: Population size and urban concentration that enable
    knowledge exchange
    While marketplace designers cannot directly control these factors, they can amplify
    their positive effects within their platforms. In the following sections we discuss some
    elements of these external factors and their implications for generative platforms (see
    Table 7.4 for a summary).

    Cultural Dynamics and Innovation Mindsets
    The cultural dimension deserves special attention because it so profoundly shapes
    how participants engage with generative marketplaces. Cultures that embrace experi
    114 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    mentation and tolerate failure tend to generate more breakthrough innovations. Plat­
    form companies can actively cultivate these cultural elements within their eco­
    systems.
    While embracing experimentation and failure tolerance are not typical measures
    of national culture found in the empirical literature, studies using the standard Hof­
    stede dimensions of culture have shown that acceptance of uncertainty (or low uncer­
    tainty avoidance), lower power distance, and higher individualism correlate with
    higher rates of innovation at the national level (Espig et al., 2021; Shane, 1993;
    Sun, 2009).
    In a different and interesting approach to measuring culture, Gelfand et al. (2011)
    provide a comprehensive examination of cultural “tightness” versus “looseness”
    across 33 nations. In “tight” cultures, as they describe them, social norms are numer­
    ous, clearly defined, and strictly enforced, leaving little room for deviant behavior. By
    contrast, “loose” cultures are characterized by a weak set of norms and a high toler­
    ance for behaviors that deviate from the norm.
    The authors detail how distal factors, such as ecological and historical threats,
    shape the degree of norm strength within a nation. Societies that have faced chal­
    lenges such as high population density, resource scarcity, frequent natural disasters,
    or prolonged territorial conflicts tend to develop tighter norms. These threats create a
    pressing need for social coordination and order, which is achieved by imposing strict
    behavioral expectations. Conversely, societies with fewer such pressures tend to ex­
    hibit looser norms, allowing for a broader range of acceptable behavior and more
    flexibility in social interactions.
    Gelfand et al. also demonstrate that the tightness or looseness of a culture is re­
    flected in everyday situations and is supported by underlying psychological processes.
    In nations with strong situational constraints, everyday settings—from classrooms to
    public parks—exhibit a narrow range of acceptable behaviors. This pervasive norma­
    tivity influences individual psychological processes, such as a heightened need for
    structure and stronger self-monitoring, which in turn reinforce the cultural system.
    The Minecraft and Roblox generative video game platforms provide an instruc­
    tive example of how platforms can influence the culture of their own ecosystem. The
    platforms have deliberately fostered a “remix culture” (Lessig, 2009, n.p.) where build­
    ing on others’ ideas is not just allowed but celebrated. This cultural development has
    resulted in an explosion of creative game development that might have been stifled in
    more restrictive environments.
    Networks and Knowledge Flows
    Research on networks has shown that people are typically part of a limited number of
    relatively closed networks where they have strong ties with others in those network,
    but little or no ties with individuals outside of those networks (Burt, 2008, 2010). We
    External Factors: The Broader Context of Generative Markets 115
    often need the trust and safety that comes with network closure. But spending a lot of
    time with like-minded individuals can lead to echo chamber effects that are not con­
    ducive to innovation (Janis, 2013; Pariser, 2011). Instead, it is precisely those weak ties
    with individuals outside of our typical networks that end up being the sources of the
    most novel ideas and innovations that we may come up with. This is a phenomenon
    famously known as “the strength of weak ties” (Granovetter, 1973, n.p.).
    Digital platforms can play a vital role in helping their ecosystem participants
    maintain this crucial balance between strong internal ties and external knowledge
    connections. Successful innovation networks need to simultaneously enhance knowl­
    edge flows among current participants while being open to external connections (Po­
    well & Grodal, 2006). Platforms can facilitate this through features like public-private
    collaboration spaces, external API integrations, and cross-platform knowledge sharing
    initiatives. They can also organize events and forums that bring together their core
    community members with outside experts, academics, and innovators from adjacent
    fields.
    Some platforms have mastered the art of bringing external knowledge to their
    supply-side participants through dedicated media efforts. Shopify’s long-running
    “Masters” podcast series exposes their merchants to insights from retail experts, suc­
    cessful entrepreneurs, and industry leaders outside the Shopify ecosystem – helping
    prevent merchants from developing platform tunnel vision. Similarly, Stripe’s “Indie
    Hackers” podcast deliberately seeks out founders using diverse business models and
    technologies, ensuring their developer community stays connected to broader entre­
    preneurship trends and opportunities beyond payments. HubSpot has taken this ap­
    proach even further by building an entire podcast network that brings marketing,
    sales, and business experts from outside their platform to share knowledge with their
    users. These platforms recognize that their supply-side participants need more than
    just platform-specific knowledge to succeed – they need ongoing exposure to external
    perspectives, emerging trends, and cross-industry insights. By facilitating these knowl­
    edge flows through podcasts and other media, they help their ecosystems stay dy­
    namic and innovative rather than becoming closed loops of internal echo chambers.
    The relationship between marketplaces and external knowledge flows works in
    both directions. Inbound knowledge flows can include benefiting from academic re­
    search and educational outputs, industry best practices and standards, public dis­
    course and cultural trends and technical innovations from adjacent fields. Outbound
    knowledge flows can include novel business models that spread to other contexts,
    technical solutions that find applications elsewhere, organizational innovations that
    influence broader business practices, and user behaviors that shape social norms.
    116 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    Educational Institutions and Learning Ecosystems
    Educational institutions play a unique dual role in shaping generative marketplaces.
    They act as knowledge producers through research while serving as knowledge multi­
    pliers through teaching. As Phelps (2013) emphasizes, the capacity for innovation in
    an economy depends heavily on its systems for developing human capital and trans­
    mitting knowledge across generations. For platform companies, educational institu­
    tions represent crucial partners (whether explicit or not) that can enhance both the
    breadth and sophistication of innovation within their ecosystems.
    The relationship between the ecosystem of user-innovators in generative plat­
    forms and educational institutions operates through multiple channels, and is espe­
    cially important when specialized knowledge and advanced education are needed to
    produce high quality innovations in the platform’s ecosystem.
    GitHub’s relationship with educational institutions provides an instructive exam­
    ple. Through GitHub Education, the platform offers free access to students and teach­
    ers, effectively seeding future developers while gathering insights from educational
    use cases. This program has evolved beyond simple tool provision to include curricu­
    lum resources, teacher training, and student certification pathways. The platform
    gains valuable insights from the innovative ways educators adapt GitHub for teach­
    ing – approaches that frequently influence professional practice.
    Similarly, AWS has built extensive educational partnerships through its AWS Edu­
    cate program, which helps universities integrate cloud computing into their curricula.
    This is a win-win partnership – universities get access to cutting-edge technology and
    teaching resources, while AWS cultivates a pipeline of cloud-native developers who
    will build businesses on their platform. The program demonstrates how educational
    partnerships can create self-reinforcing cycles of innovation and adoption.
    These relationships require careful orchestration. Platform companies must bal­
    ance their commercial interests with academic freedom, manage intellectual property
    rights across institutional boundaries, and adapt their typical timelines to academic
    cycles. However, when managed effectively, educational institutions can become pow­
    erful amplifiers of platform generativity. Platform leaders can leverage educational
    institutions through several key mechanisms:
72. Research partnerships that advance platform technologies
73. Educational programs that train future innovators
74. Experimental testbeds for new platform features
75. Certification programs that build ecosystem expertise
76. Community building through academic networks
    External Factors: The Broader Context of Generative Markets 117
    Leveraging Urban Population Centers
    The role of geographic concentration in innovation, extensively studied by scholars
    like Glaeser (2012) in his work on the “Triumph of the City,” remains crucial even for
    digital platforms. As Phelps (2013) emphasizes, the agglomeration of populations in cit­
    ies creates powerful opportunities for knowledge exchange and community building
    that can accelerate innovation. Rather than trying to replicate these effects purely dig­
    itally, successful platforms actively tap into existing urban communities and net­
    works.
    Cities naturally foster an environment where diverse talent and a mix of cultural,
    economic, and creative energies converge. Glaeser (2012) argues that the density of
    cities is a critical engine for economic growth because it promotes rapid knowledge
    spillovers. Jane Jacobs (1992) argued long ago that the very design of cities—with their
    mixed-use neighborhoods and lively streets—cultivates the kind of everyday encoun­
    ters that underpin community resilience and innovation.
    An example of what digital platforms do to allow urban population centers to
    feed their generativity is to hold a variety of local events in different communities.
    For example, Webflow maintains an events page that highlights local meetups and
    community gatherings around the world. This practice not only leverages the inher­
    ent advantages of population centers but also reinforces the role of physical, in-
    person interactions in sustaining a vibrant innovation ecosystem. Similarly, platforms
    like Shopify organize merchant meetups in major cities, drawing on the natural en­
    ergy of urban environments to spark collaboration and knowledge sharing among en­
    trepreneurs. GitHub’s sponsorship of coding workshops and hackathons is yet an­
    other example where digital communities are brought into physical spaces, creating
    an intersection where ideas can flourish and evolve through direct interaction.
    Regulatory Considerations
    In many cases, regulatory frameworks are designed to protect consumers and ensure
    fair competition, yet they can also constrain digital platforms in many ways. Navigat­
    ing these constraints is not a trivial matter.
    Airbnb offers a clear example of a platform that has navigated this terrain by en­
    gaging with regulators across diverse jurisdictions. The company has adopted a proac­
    tive stance—working with local governments on issues ranging from housing regula­
    tions to taxation. Although this approach has sometimes slowed expansion in specific
    markets, it has ultimately contributed to a more sustainable and trusted business
    model.
    In Europe, the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) il­
    lustrates how comprehensive regulatory frameworks can impact platform operations.
    GDPR has redefined data privacy standards by mandating greater transparency,
    118 Chapter 7 Designing Markets for Generativity
    stricter consent requirements, and enhanced rights for users over their personal data.
    As digital platforms adjust to these requirements, they are compelled to integrate ro­
    bust data protection measures into their business practices. While compliance can in­
    troduce additional costs and operational constraints, it also fosters greater consumer
    trust and ultimately contributes to a more resilient marketplace.
    Conclusion: Architecting for Generative Growth
    The deliberate design of generative marketplaces represents a profound shift in how
    we think about market creation in the digital age. While traditional market design
    focuses primarily on allocation efficiency, we’ve argued throughout this chapter that
    unleashing the generative potential of marketplaces requires a more sophisticated ar­
    chitectural approach that spans three interconnected layers: allocation, generation,
    and appropriation.
    The allocation layer provides the essential foundation – creating the thickness,
    matching efficiency, and trust mechanisms needed for basic market function. But un­
    like marketplaces that optimize purely for matching, generative marketplaces must
    design these foundational elements with distributed innovation in mind. However,
    the matching function must still work well for the marketplace to be able to operate
    at all. Matching mechanisms need to balance efficiency with discovery. Trust and
    safety systems must protect while enabling experimentation.
    The generation layer transforms this foundation into an engine of continuous in­
    novation. Through carefully orchestrated diversity, rich interaction mechanisms, and
    robust experimentation systems, this layer enables platforms to tap into what Hayek
    (2002) called the “distributed knowledge” of market participants. The most successful
    platforms don’t just wait passively for innovation to happen – they actively design for
    it, creating environments where breakthrough ideas are more likely to emerge and
    spread. This requires sophisticated infrastructure for knowledge sharing, collabora­
    tion, and organizational support.
    The appropriation layer completes the architecture by ensuring sustainable value
    capture without stifling generativity. This involves entrepreneur-friendly revenue
    models, thoughtful design of control points, data advantages, and curation mecha­
    nisms that align platform success with participant success. The most effective plat­
    forms find a beautiful structure of incentives that allows them to profit from distrib­
    uted innovation while maintaining the trust and engagement that drive continued
    participation.
    These layers don’t operate in isolation but rather reinforce each other in power­
    ful ways. A well-designed allocation layer creates incentives that drive activity in the
    generation layer. The generation layer produces innovations that create value, which
    the appropriation layer can then help distribute in ways that encourage more innova­
    tion. When all three layers work in harmony, they create a self-reinforcing system
    Conclusion: Architecting for Generative Growth 119
    where each layer strengthens the others, enabling sustained innovation at scale. This
    architecture must also be thoughtfully embedded within broader institutional, cul­
    tural, and demographic contexts.
    As we wrap up a long section of the book on market generativity, let us circle
    back to the idea of product generativity, and look into the synergies between product
    generativity and market generativity in the next chapter.
    Chapter 8
    The Generativity Flywheel
    The most powerful manifestations of generativity occur when generative products
    and generative markets combine to create self-reinforcing cycles of innovation and
    value creation. This phenomenon, which we call the “generativity flywheel,” explains
    why companies that successfully harness both forms of generativity—like Apple, Goo­
    gle, and Amazon—have achieved unprecedented scale and durability in their compet­
    itive advantages.
    Before detailing the product-market generativity framework and the stages of the
    generativity flywheel, I would like to devote a section to why I have emphasized the
    value of markets being built on top of generative products and the idea of profitability
    as a design characteristic of generative products so much in this book. In short, it is
    because of the high-powered incentives.
    Market Incentives as Innovation Accelerant: The Power of Profit
    Much of the literature on open innovation, ecosystems, and platform strategy over­
    looks a fundamental truth: the most powerful way to drive sustained distributed inno­
    vation is to help people make money. While discussions often focus on community
    building, knowledge sharing, and strategic alignment, the simple reality is that profit
    potential drives both the scale and sophistication of innovation in ways that other in­
    centives cannot match.
    The limitations of non-profit-driven approaches are evident in practice. Open source
    projects, despite their ideological appeal and occasional breakthroughs, often struggle
    with maintenance, systematic improvement, and user support. Community platforms
    generate enthusiastic early participation but rarely sustain professional-grade innova­
    tion. Even sophisticated ecosystem approaches that emphasize strategic partnerships
    often falter because they don’t create clear paths to profitability for participants.
    Market-based incentives fundamentally transform this dynamic. When Shopify
    opened its app marketplace, it created opportunities for third-party innovation, not
    just as quirky side-projects but as viable paths to entrepreneurial wealth. Shopify de­
    velopers can build multi-million dollar businesses around their innovations.
    This profit potential justifies significant investments that would be impossible to
    sustain through other motivations. When an innovator in your ecosystem can profit
    well, they can engage in activities and investments that turn them into even more ca­
    pable innovators. For example: hiring specialized talent, conducting extensive market
    research, developing sophisticated technical solutions, providing enterprise-grade
    https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110779639-008
    Market Incentives as Innovation Accelerant: The Power of Profit 121
    support, maintaining and improving products over years, marketing and customer ac­
    quisition, building sales and support teams, etc.
    Mobile app stores dramatically illustrate this dynamic. They created thousands of
    millionaires among app developers, spawned numerous public companies, and en­
    abled countless developers to build sustainable businesses. This profit potential at­
    tracted massive talent and investment to mobile app innovation, driving both quan­
    tity and quality of apps far beyond what other incentive systems could achieve.
    Even in traditionally open source domains, the introduction of profit potential
    transforms innovation dynamics. While WordPress itself remains open source, its
    commercial plugin marketplace enables sophisticated innovation through profit in­
    centives. Complex e-commerce, security, and performance optimization plugins com­
    mand premium prices, enabling their creators to build viable business around their
    innovations on the WordPress platform. Premium plugins like WooCommerce, Yoast
    SEO, and Wordfence command prices from hundreds to thousands of dollars annually
    per customer. These prices support sophisticated development teams and enable con­
    tinuous innovation. The results – in terms of functionality, reliability, and user experi­
    ence – far exceed what voluntary contribution models typically achieve.
    The market mechanism becomes particularly powerful when combined with
    product generativity. A generative product creates expansive possibility spaces for in­
    novation, while profit potential directs sustained investment toward valuable oppor­
    tunities within those spaces. The marketplace acts as a massive parallel search pro­
    cess, using price signals to guide both the direction and intensity of innovation
    efforts. Unlike approaches that rely primarily on intrinsic motivation or strategic
    alignment, profit incentives enable focused, sustained investment in innovation while
    maintaining the advantages of distributed, parallel exploration.
    Crucial to this dynamic is ensuring innovators capture a significant portion of the
    value they create. As discussed previously, well-designed marketplaces enable this
    through support mechanisms such as:
    – Clear monetization mechanisms
    – Reasonable platform fee structures
    – Intellectual property protection
    – Support for premium pricing
    – Infrastructure for recurring revenue
    – Tools for customer relationship management
    – Payment and subscription handling
    Failing to provide the right tools to transform your user-innovators to profit-generating
    entrepreneurs is an unfortunately common mistake among companies with generative
    products. This is what I call the problem of not taking your users seriously enough as
    entrepreneurs. Oceans of opportunity have been lost because of this problem.
    In our interviews with Bubble plugin developers for example, we found that
    these developers had many frustrations with the supports provided by the platform.
    122 Chapter 8 The Generativity Flywheel
    One plugin developer remarked that “I think this is a complaint that I have about the
    bubble system . . . So I don’t know what the lifetime value of a user is. Because it’s
    like completely anonymous, and just a black box to me . . . I think there’s the opportu­
    nity to give users our plugin builders a lot more data about their users, so that they
    can make more intelligent decisions.” These power users can provide a rich set of
    ideas to the platforms for product features that would help them be serious entrepre­
    neurs as user-innovators. For example, this developer went on to say, “One thing that
    I feel like could be tricky to implement, but could be highly valuable for both the
    plugin developers and Bubble is opening up an AB testing framework for pricing.”
    We also found in our interviews that sometimes non-monetary incentives were
    able to drive plugin developers to contribute despite a lack of profit. One developer
    said, “it was mainly out of curiosity, but I also saw it as a way to market myself,” and
    another remarked that “being part of a community makes you do things for reasons
    other than making money.” However, while these curiosity incentives may drive
    some innovators in the early stages, they cannot sustain long-term effort. Simply put,
    curiosity does not pay the bills.
    Sustaining Innovation Through Career-Level Commitment
    The most powerful manifestation of profit-driven innovation occurs when participants
    can build entire careers and organizations around your platform. This transforms their
    relationship with the platform from occasional contribution to deep, long-term commit­
    ment. When innovators can reliably shape their professional futures around your eco­
    system, they invest in ways that transcend typical platform participation.
    Consider the ecosystem that has evolved around Bubble’s no-code platform. Nu­
    merous companies exist solely to develop and maintain plugins for Bubble. These
    aren’t just individual developers creating side projects—they’re full-fledged busi­
    nesses with dedicated teams, professional development practices, and long-term
    growth strategies. Some plugin developers have built substantial companies, com­
    pleted strategic acquisitions of other plugins, and shaped entire careers around ex­
    tending Bubble’s capabilities. Zeroqode, a company built entirely around building and
    maintaining plugins for the Bubble no-code platform, lists more than 50 employees on
    their website as of the time of writing.
    This career-level commitment enables a number of crucial dynamics:
77. Deep Platform Expertise: Participants invest years mastering platform intricacies.
78. Long-term Innovation Planning: Development roadmaps extend months or years
    ahead.
79. Specialized Skill Development: Teams cultivate unique platform-specific capabilities.
80. Customer Relationship Building: Organizations develop lasting user relationships.
81. Ecosystem Investment: Participants contribute to platform growth and evolution.
    The Product-Market Generativity Framework 123
82. Knowledge Accumulation: Deep expertise gets codified and shared.
83. Professional Networks: Specialized communities of practice emerge.
    This emphasis on profit-driven innovation and career-level commitment doesn’t pre­
    clude other motivations. Open source, community contribution, and strategic partner­
    ship all play valuable roles. But profit potential uniquely enables the scale, sophistica­
    tion, and sustainability of innovation that a truly generative platform requires.
    Platform leaders who truly understand this don’t just tolerate participant profits or
    think of them as amusing side-effects—they actively help innovators in their ecosys­
    tems build profitable, sustainable businesses and careers.
    The Product-Market Generativity Framework
    To understand the interplay between product and market generativity, we can think
    of a two by two framework that categorizes companies based on their levels of prod­
    uct generativity (the capacity of a product to enable user-driven innovation) and mar­
    ket generativity (the ability of a marketplace to harness distributed innovation). Each
    quadrant provides insights into different innovation dynamics and strategic pathways
    (see Figure 8.1).
    Quadrant 4: High Product, Low Market Generativity
    These companies excel in creating products with significant generative potential
    but initially lack a structured marketplace for user-driven innovations. Over time,
    many transition to Quadrant 1 by building marketplaces around their products.
    And in the meantime, unofficial or third-party marketplaces sometimes arise to ad­
    dress the gap.
    Examples:
    – Raspberry Pi: Initially designed as a flexible computing tool for education and DIY projects, with no
    formal ecosystem for sharing or selling add-ons.
    – Notion: A modular workspace that allows extensive customization but lacked a marketplace for tem­
    plates or extensions in its early stages.
    – LEGO (Pre-LEGO Ideas): Empowered creativity through its building blocks but for many years there
    was no way for users to profit from their innovations with LEGO in a marketplace.
    – Coda (Before Packs Marketplace): Enabled users to create custom workflows but lacked a formal­
    ized platform for sharing or monetizing these innovations.
    124 Chapter 8 The Generativity Flywheel
    Quadrant 3: Low Product, Low Market Generativity
    Companies in this quadrant offer products and marketplaces that are relatively closed
    to external innovation. Their growth typically relies on internal innovation and effi­
    ciency rather than distributed creativity.
    Examples:
    – Uber: Focused on matching supply and demand (drivers and riders), with limited user-driven custom­
    ization or broader ecosystem innovation.
    – Hermès: A luxury brand offering meticulously crafted products through tightly controlled distribution
    channels, emphasizing internal craftsmanship and tradition rather than external innovation or mar­
    ketplace dynamism.
    – Peloton: A fitness platform with tightly controlled content, offering little room for user or developer
    innovation.
    Quadrant 2: Low Product, High Market Generativity
    Platforms in this quadrant build vibrant marketplaces or ecosystems without inher­
    ently generative core products. They rely on enabling contributors to create value
    through the marketplace rather than the product itself. However, sometimes they try
    to create generative products or innovation toolkits that allow more people to partici­
    pate more easily in their marketplaces. Other times a third-party product may enter
    the game to take advantage of the opportunity when high demand exists to partici­
    pate in a dynamic marketplace.
    Examples:
    – Etsy: Provides a generative marketplace for artisans and small businesses but does not offer a partic­
    ularly generative product.
    – Amazon Marketplace: While Amazon has created a highly dynamic marketplace with millions of
    third-party sellers, its core marketplace product remains primarily a transaction and distribution plat­
    form. Amazon has leveraged this marketplace to build more generative products (see section below
    on “Building Generative Products from Generative Markets.”)
    – eBay: Offers a vibrant marketplace with extensive opportunity for sellers to innovate in what they offer
    and how they present it, but its core product focuses on facilitating transactions rather than providing
    generative tools. eBay’s platform doesn’t enable users to build new functionalities or extend its core
    capabilities in unpredictable ways—it primarily optimizes the buying and selling process.
    The Product-Market Generativity Framework 125
    Quadrant 1: High Product, High Market Generativity
    This quadrant represents the most generative systems, where companies combine open,
    innovative products with ecosystems that foster distributed creativity and innovation.
    This synergy creates flywheel effects, accelerating growth and innovation potential.
    Examples:
    – Google and Apple (Smartphones & App Stores): Combines generative hardware and software with
    a marketplace that empowers developers to innovate and monetize.
    – Roblox: Allows users to create games and monetize them within a thriving ecosystem, fostering both
    product and market generativity.
    – Minecraft: Offers an open-ended creative platform and supports mods and marketplaces for user-
    generated content.
    – WordPress: A highly flexible Content Management System (CMS) with a robust ecosystem of themes,
    plugins, and professional services.
    – YouTube: Enables content creation through advanced tools and a marketplace that allows creators
    to monetize and experiment.
    Figure 8.1: The Product-Market Generativity Framework with Examples.
    126 Chapter 8 The Generativity Flywheel
    Building Generative Markets from Generative Products
    Some companies begin in Quadrant 4—focused on highly generative products—and
    later evolve to Quadrant 1 by building ecosystems and marketplaces around their
    products. This is a very natural pattern because a generative product provides the
    ideal conditions for the formation of a generative marketplace.
    The potential is so high that if the company itself does not create and manage a
    marketplace around its generative product, unofficial marketplaces will naturally
    form to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity. This is the case for example with
    templates for Microsoft Excel. Millions of users around the world innovated for years
    with these templates but Microsoft never created a managed marketplace to help
    these innovators profit from their work. While some users have found workarounds
    and sell Excel templates on Etsy or Gumroad or Shopify, it is possible that many more
    users could have contributed to a generative marketplace if Microsoft had decided to
    explicitly create one.
    However, the custom GPT marketplace saga has demonstrated that creating mar­
    ketplaces is not easy. Many companies enjoyed growth through product generativity
    for years before being able to set up a marketplace around their product. Some exam­
    ples include:
    Raspberry Pi: From DIY Innovation to Ecosystem of Tools and Add-Ons
    Raspberry Pi began as a generative product—a low-cost, flexible computing platform
    designed for educational and hobbyist use. Early adopters leveraged its adaptability
    to create a vast range of projects, from home automation systems to robotics. Initially,
    there was no formalized marketplace around Raspberry Pi, and users had to rely on
    forums and informal channels for components and project ideas.
    Raspberry Pi eventually fostered an ecosystem that included accessory market­
    places, official hardware extensions (e.g., cameras and sensors), and a thriving net­
    work of distributors offering compatible products. The foundation also supports plat­
    forms for sharing project designs and educational resources, solidifying its position as
    both a generative product and a market.
    Notion: From Customizable Workspace to Template Marketplace
    Notion started as a highly generative product—a flexible, modular workspace allow­
    ing users to create tailored solutions for note-taking, project management, and more.
    However, for a long time, it lacked a formal marketplace to share or monetize these
    innovations.
    Recognizing the potential of its user-generated templates, Notion launched a tem­
    plate gallery and later encouraged users to monetize their creations. The marketplace
    provides a structured environment for sharing workflows and templates, turning in­
    dividual customizations into communal resources.
    The Product-Market Generativity Framework 127
    LEGO: From Blocks to Collaborative Design and Monetization
    LEGO has always been a generative product, empowering users to create virtually
    anything with its iconic building blocks. Historically, however, LEGO operated within
    a product-centric model, with limited engagement in user-driven design beyond fan
    communities.
    LEGO embraced market generativity through initiatives like the LEGO Ideas plat­
    form, where fans can submit designs that, if selected, are turned into official sets with
    revenue-sharing opportunities. This move created a marketplace of co-creation, har­
    nessing the creativity of its user base to fuel product development and engagement.
    Coda: From All-In-One Document Tool to Packs Marketplace
    Coda was designed as a generative product—a tool allowing users to create custom
    workflows, applications, and collaborative documents. Initially, it lacked a market­
    place for users to share or monetize these innovations.
    Coda launched its Packs marketplace in July 2022, nearly four years after it had
    introduced the concept of packs as a way to integrate third-party apps into Coda. In
    2022, the Packs marketplace finally allowed users to make money from the Packs they
    made, and an easy-to-use Pack Studio product was also launched to help users make
    those Packs.
    Building Generative Products from Generative Markets
    Although this is a less common pattern, it is possible to start from a generative mar­
    ketplace, and gradually create products that make it easier for more people to partici­
    pate more easily in that marketplace.
    An illustrative example here is Amazon. Already having a dynamic and rich mar­
    ketplace, the company has made various forays into products that make it easier for
    people to become profit-generating merchants. Examples include:
84. Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA): By transforming warehouse management and lo­
    gistics into a generative product, Amazon dramatically lowered the barriers to
    entry for small sellers. FBA enabled entrepreneurs to experiment with different
    inventory management strategies and compete at an enterprise scale without
    massive capital investments. This innovation spawned entirely new business
    models, from retail arbitrage to private label brands, and created opportunities
    for an ecosystem of tools and services focused on FBA optimization.
85. Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP): This product transformed the publishing indus­
    try by turning the entire publishing process into an easy do-it-yourself process.
    Authors gained the ability to experiment with pricing, marketing, and content
    strategies in ways that traditional publishing never allowed. This flexibility en
    128 Chapter 8 The Generativity Flywheel
    abled new genres and formats to emerge, supported rapid iteration and market
    testing, and ultimately led to the growth of an entire independent publishing eco­
    system.
86. Amazon Merch on Demand: This product converted merchandise creation into
    a generative product. By eliminating inventory risk, the platform enabled design­
    ers to experiment with different concepts and rapidly test new niches. This cre­
    ated opportunities for design-focused entrepreneurs who previously lacked the
    resources to enter the merchandise market, and fostered the development of spe­
    cialized design tools and services.
    Similar to the case of building markets on top of generative products, if you have a
    generative market that could benefit from a generative product or some sort of user
    toolkit to make it easier to participate in the product, then it will make sense for such
    a thing to exist. If you do not build it yourself, someone else may beat you to it. You
    may in fact desire this if you think an ecosystem of third-party providers will be bet­
    ter than one centrally controlled system, or that there is no reason to compete with
    already existing third-party tools that enable innovations in your marketplace. For ex­
    ample, while Amazon has itself built “Amazon Merch on Demand,” Shopify and Etsy
    have not built such platforms for their users. However, users have found third-party
    options like Printful or Printify that can integrate with Shopify or Etsy, and provide
    the full “merch on demand” pipeline that makes it easy for new entrepreneurs to
    start selling merchandise on these platforms.
    Similarly, mobile app marketplaces provided a ripe opportunity for Google or
    Apple to provide no-code app building tools to users. Despite a number of efforts, no
    products by either company succeeded in attracting a large number of non-developer
    users to the app-making process. An entire industry of no-code software development
    platforms was created to address this gap.
    The Six Stages of the Generativity Flywheel
    Product generativity and market generativity create powerful chain reactions when
    they work together effectively. A generative product first attracts innovative users
    who see its creative potential. These users, supported by market mechanisms and in­
    centives, begin exploring and expanding the product’s possibility spaces through
    novel applications. As these innovations demonstrate new value and attract broader
    user segments, the market provides ways for innovators to capture value from their
    creations. This in turn attracts more innovative users and inspires new ways of using
    the product, leading to further expansions of the possibility space. This mutually rein­
    forcing cycle creates what we call the “generativity flywheel” – a self-sustaining en­
    gine of innovation that continuously expands both what is possible and what is profit­
    able (see Figure 8.2).
    The Six Stages of the Generativity Flywheel 129
    Figure 8.2: The Generativity Flywheel.
    While the generativity flywheel might superficially resemble network effects, it repre­
    sents a fundamentally different mechanism. Network effects, as theorized by Katz
    and Shapiro (1994), describe how a product becomes more valuable as more people
    use it. The generativity flywheel, however, creates value not just through increased
    adoption but through the expansion of possibility spaces. This creates combinatorial
    growth patterns where innovations can build on each other in exponentially increas­
    ing ways. The market effectively functions as a massive parallel experimentation en­
    gine, testing countless combinations simultaneously.
    Consider Roblox, the gaming platform. Traditional network effects make Roblox
    more valuable because more players mean more people to play with. But the genera­
    tivity flywheel goes further: each successful game on Roblox potentially inspires new
    game mechanics, virtual economy innovations, or social features that expand what is
    possible on the platform. This continuous expansion of possibilities creates a form of
    strategic advantage that is particularly difficult for competitors to replicate.
    We can break down the generativity flywheel into six interconnected stages that
    create a powerful engine of continuous innovation and value creation.
    Stage 1: Attract Innovative Users
    The flywheel begins when a product’s generative potential attracts users who see pos­
    sibilities beyond its obvious applications. These users are drawn to products with ac­
    130 Chapter 8 The Generativity Flywheel
    cessible entry points but deep possibility spaces—paths that invite experimentation
    and are rich with opportunity. These users recognize latent potential in the product’s
    design and are motivated by the opportunity to create novel solutions.
    Consider how Minecraft initially attracted technically sophisticated users who
    saw beyond its simple block-building mechanics. These early adopters—modders,
    server operators, and content creators—recognized the game’s potential as a platform
    for creativity well before it became a global phenomenon. Their early innovations,
    from custom server modifications to elaborate in-game computers, demonstrated pos­
    sibilities that Mojang (Minecraft’s creator) hadn’t itself recognized.
    Stage 2: Create Novel Applications
    As innovative users begin working with the product, they create applications that
    demonstrate the breadth of its possibility space. These aren’t just new features—
    they’re fundamental expansions of what the product can do. Each novel application
    serves as a proof-of-concept that inspires others to imagine even more possibilities.
    The history of spreadsheet software provides a compelling example. While Visi­
    Calc was initially designed for financial calculations, users quickly adapted it for ev­
    erything from project management to game design. Each novel application demon­
    strated the platform’s flexibility and inspired others to imagine new possibilities.
    Stage 3: Increase Product Value
    Novel applications expand the product’s value proposition in two crucial ways. First,
    they create immediate utility by solving specific user needs. More importantly, they
    demonstrate entirely new categories of use that expand the product’s perceived possi­
    bility space. This expansion attracts new user segments who previously didn’t see the
    product as relevant to their needs.
    Apple’s App Store perfectly illustrates this dynamic. Each innovative app—
    whether it is a revolutionary photo editing tool or a groundbreaking augmented real­
    ity application—not only serves existing users but also attracts new users who previ­
    ously saw no value in smartphones. The platform becomes more valuable not just be­
    cause it has more apps, but because it continuously reveals new possibilities.
    Stage 4: Attract More Users
    As the product’s possibility space expands, it attracts an increasingly diverse user
    base. Each new user segment brings distinct needs, perspectives, and creative ap­
    proaches, further accelerating the expansion of possibilities. This diversity creates a
    Conclusion 131
    compound effect where innovations from one domain inspire applications in others,
    leading to unexpected combinations and novel use cases.
    Consider how Roblox evolved from a children’s gaming platform to a sophisti­
    cated ecosystem for digital experiences. As it attracted older users, professional devel­
    opers, and educational institutions, each group brought new ideas about what the
    platform could become, further fueling its generative potential.
    Stage 5: Enable Value Capture
    For the flywheel to maintain momentum, the platform must help innovators trans­
    form their creations into sustainable ventures. User-innovators must be taken seri­
    ously as entrepreneurs. Successful platforms provide tools for business management,
    customer relationship building, and market expansion, treating user-innovators as se­
    rious entrepreneurs.
    Shopify exemplifies this stage effectively. Beyond providing tools for building on­
    line stores, it creates multiple pathways for value capture: app developers can mone­
    tize through the app store, theme designers can sell templates, and experts can offer
    services through the Shopify Partners program. This rich ecosystem of value capture
    opportunities ensures continued investment in innovation.
    Stage 6: Expand Innovation Possibilities
    The final stage—which feeds directly back into attracting innovative users—involves
    systematically expanding the possibility space for future innovations. Successful plat­
    forms achieve this by converting proven innovations into accessible building blocks,
    creating tools that lower barriers to innovation, and establishing knowledge sharing
    mechanisms that accelerate creative recombination.
    At this stage, successful innovations become building blocks for future creativity.
    When Stripe demonstrated how to simplify online payments through APIs, it didn’t
    just solve one problem—it created a foundation for countless financial technology in­
    novations. Each expansion of possibilities attracts new innovative users, completing
    one cycle of the flywheel while setting the stage for the next.
    Conclusion
    The generativity flywheel represents a fundamental shift in how we think about inno­
    vation and value creation in the digital age. When product generativity and market
    generativity work in concert, they create something more powerful than either force
    alone: a self-reinforcing engine of innovation that continuously expands what is possi
    132 Chapter 8 The Generativity Flywheel
    ble while ensuring that valuable possibilities are discovered and developed. This dy­
    namic explains why platforms that master both forms of generativity—like Apple’s
    App Store, Roblox’s gaming ecosystem, or WordPress’s publishing platform—achieve
    unprecedented scale and durability in their competitive advantages.
    The ideas of product-market generativity and the generativity flywheel provide
    thinking tools for platform strategy. Whether starting with a generative product and
    building market mechanisms around it, or beginning with a marketplace and develop­
    ing tools to enhance participation, success requires careful attention to both sides of
    the generativity equation. The product-market generativity framework provides a
    roadmap for this journey, helping companies understand their current position and
    chart a path toward fuller realization of generative potential.

    Generativity in Practice: The Trade-offs
    and Challenges of Generativity
    The allure of generativity lies in its promise: the ability to unlock a practically bound­
    less ecosystem of profit-generating innovation. But while the generativity advantage
    is enticing, its implementation is far more complex and fraught than it initially seems.
    Firms embarking on this journey soon realize they must navigate a labyrinth of ten­
    sions, trade-offs, and dilemmas. OpenAI discovered this with the “laundry buddy”
    saga discussed in the opening of this book. Even with their core product ChatGPT that
    took the world by storm, there was no shortage of people mocking or undermining
    the technology, calling it a “stochastic parrot” (Bender et al., 2021) or “glorified tape
    recorder” (Cao, 2023).
    Steve Jobs was initially hesitant to allow third-party apps on the iPhone, prefer­
    ring to maintain control and a high bar for quality. Microsoft never created a man­
    aged marketplace for Excel templates. The Bubble no-code platform hasn’t yet pro­
    vided proper documentation to its plugin developers on how to build plugins.
    Google’s Gemini large language models had APIs that were so notoriously more diffi­
    cult to use than those of OpenAI that they had to simplify them after community back­
    lash. It took years for Coda to establish a marketplace around its extremely generative
    product. In short, achieving a generativity advantage is not easy, and not something
    to be taken for granted.
    These cases are no accidents—they result from the qualities embedded in the
    very DNA of generative ecosystems which thrive on openness, collaboration, and dis­
    tributed innovation. Yet these same qualities clash directly with the traditional imper­
    atives of control, predictability, and operational efficiency in business strategy. The
    pursuit of generativity is not a linear path, nor is it a guaranteed formula for success.
    It demands that organizations step into uncharted territory, often embracing ambigu­
    ity and risk. It forces firms to confront uncomfortable questions: How much control
    should they relinquish? What inefficiencies are they willing to tolerate? How do they
    balance the needs of their core operations with the demands of innovation at the
    edges?
    This chapter focuses on the tensions and trade-offs that typically arise as organi­
    zations strive to pursue a generativity advantage in practice. See Table 9.1 for a sum­
    mary. Drawing on both scholarly insights and real-world examples, we explore these
    tensions in depth, offering actionable remedies to help firms navigate this challenging
    yet rewarding terrain. Implementing generativity may be easier said than done, but
    for those who embrace its complexities, the rewards can be transformative.

    Control Versus Generativity
    The tension between control and generativity is a fundamental paradox that must be
    dealt with in any effort to implement or pursue a generativity advantage. The open­
    ness characteristic of generative systems fuels innovation, attracts users, and expands
    the platform’s reach, forming a self-reinforcing dynamic. However, this very openness
    creates a challenge for the platform owner who also seeks to maintain a level of con­
    trol over the ecosystem (Tilson et al., 2010). Control becomes necessary to ensure qual­
    ity, security, and strategic alignment with the platform’s vision. The tension arises be­
    cause control can stifle the very generativity it seeks to harness, leading to a potential
    decrease in innovation (Cennamo & Santaló, 2019). The platform owner must carefully
    balance these competing forces to maximize the platform’s potential.
    136 Chapter 9 Generativity in Practice: The Trade-offs and Challenges of Generativity
    The challenge is that generativity requires some level of decentralization, allow­
    ing various actors to innovate in an uncoordinated fashion. This differs from tradi­
    tional, hierarchical management structures where control is centralized, and innova­
    tion is managed from within the firm. The platform owner has to relinquish some of
    its command and control over the platform’s evolution, and instead has to rely on ex­
    ternal actors to drive the platform in unforeseen directions (Eaton et al., 2011). This
    creates a risk that the platform might evolve in ways that are not aligned with the
    owner’s strategic goals. Conversely, over-controlling the platform can inhibit the flow
    of ideas and dampen the enthusiasm of external developers, reducing the platform’s
    potential for expansion. The platform owner is thus in a constant balancing act, seek­
    ing to optimize the level of control and to leverage the power of the crowd for innova­
    tion while protecting the platform’s key assets. This constant adjustment and recali­
    bration is a key feature of managing digital platforms.
    Real-World Example: Apple’s Shifting Stance on iOS Development
    Apple’s journey with the iOS platform offers a compelling case study of the tension
    between control and generativity (Eaton et al., 2015). Initially, Apple adopted a highly
    controlled approach, requiring all applications to be approved through their App
    Store. This curation ensured a high level of quality and security, but it also limited the
    range of applications and the autonomy of developers. The company’s policy also re­
    stricted the use of certain technologies, such as Adobe Flash, for reasons of security
    and performance. This control generated friction with the developer community who
    often felt that their innovative efforts were being stifled. The result was a tension be­
    tween Apple’s desire to control the user experience and developers’ desire to create
    innovative apps. However, over time, Apple has gradually relaxed some of its restric­
    tions, allowing more apps to be developed and distributed, and introducing more flex­
    ible development tools. The move was clearly influenced by the need to leverage the
    creativity and distributed innovation of external developers. This highlights the dy­
    namic nature of the control-generativity tension, requiring platforms to adapt to the
    shifting needs of their users and their ecosystems.
    Apple’s initial stance on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) apps provides an­
    other example of this dynamic. At first, Apple restricted VoIP applications on its plat­
    form, likely due to concerns about competition with its telecommunications partners.
    This created tensions with third party developers who wanted to offer innovative al­
    ternatives to established telecommunication providers. However, under pressure
    from the user and developer communities, and with increasing competitive pressures,
    Apple eventually relaxed its position, allowing VoIP apps while establishing certain
    parameters for their functionality. These examples illustrate how control is not simply
    an on/off switch but rather a strategic choice that needs to be adjusted in response to
    the dynamics of the ecosystem.
    Control Versus Generativity 137
    Potential Remedies: Balancing Control and Generativity
    The tension between control and generativity cannot be resolved by choosing one
    over the other; rather, it calls for finding a delicate balance. One key strategy involves
    using boundary resources to structure the interaction between the platform and its
    ecosystem (Ghazawneh & Henfridsson, 2013). We have talked about boundary resour­
    ces earlier in this book but did not emphasize one key feature: they are modular in­
    terfaces that allow external actors to develop complementary innovations while en­
    suring that the core architecture of the platform remains under the control of the
    platform owner. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Develop­
    ment Kits (SDKs) act as such boundary resources by enabling third parties to build on
    the platform without having direct access to the core source code. Boundary resour­
    ces, therefore, offer a way to channel external creativity while still safeguarding the
    platform’s strategic objectives. The design of these resources is key as it determines
    the types of innovation that are possible on the platform. Therefore, careful calibra­
    tion of these boundary resources is needed to both promote innovation and protect
    platform integrity.
    Another effective approach is to use governance mechanisms, which establish
    clear rules, guidelines, and incentives for ecosystem participants, while maintaining a
    degree of flexibility. Governance mechanisms can include things such as transparent
    review processes for applications, guidelines that foster positive network effects, and
    well-designed user feedback mechanisms that offer developers crucial information.
    Effective governance helps align the actions of external actors with the overall goals
    of the platform by establishing clear and predictable behavioral boundaries. By mak­
    ing the rules explicit and providing channels for feedback, platform owners can en­
    courage responsible innovation and mitigate the risk of uncontrolled development.
    This approach recognizes that control does not have to be top-down but can be a pro­
    cess of guiding and coordinating the actions of the ecosystem as a whole. The key is to
    shift the mindset from control as a mechanism of restriction to control as a tool for
    enabling and coordinating a vibrant ecosystem.
    Finally, the platform owner needs to establish processes for dynamic adaptation
    by regularly evaluating the effectiveness of its control mechanisms and adjusting
    them as required (Eaton et al., 2011). This involves monitoring the ecosystem for dis­
    ruptive innovations and using a variety of channels to collect feedback from ecosys­
    tem participants, and responding to this feedback by adapting the platform’s bound­
    ary resources and governance mechanisms. Furthermore, platform owners can
    facilitate this by creating a culture of experimentation that welcomes failure as a
    learning opportunity. By staying responsive and agile, platform owners can adapt to
    the constantly evolving needs of their ecosystems, and by constantly tuning their con­
    trol mechanisms, they can prevent the stifling of generativity. This constant evolution
    highlights the importance of a flexible mindset when it comes to balancing control
    and generativity, and the need to adapt to the dynamic nature of digital ecosystems.
    138 Chapter 9 Generativity in Practice: The Trade-offs and Challenges of Generativity
    By carefully calibrating boundary resources, governance mechanisms, and adap­
    tive processes, platform owners can effectively manage the inherent tensions between
    control and generativity, fostering a vibrant ecosystem that creates value for all stake­
    holders involved.
    Stability Versus Flexibility
    The tension between stability and flexibility is another core paradox that platform
    owners must navigate to foster successful ecosystems (Tilson et al., 2010). While gener­
    ativity provides the potential for unbounded innovation, platforms also require a de­
    gree of stability to function predictably and reliably. Stability in a digital platform
    context refers to the consistency of the platform’s core functions, interfaces, and
    rules, ensuring that the platform remains a reliable foundation for innovation. This
    stability allows developers to build on the platform with a degree of confidence,
    knowing that their work will not be disrupted by unforeseen changes. However, this
    very need for stability can create inertia and hinder the platform’s ability to adapt to
    new technological trends and user needs (Lyytinen et al., 2017). Therefore, platform
    owners must balance this need for stability against the need for flexibility, which is
    the capacity of the platform to evolve in response to changing conditions. This in­
    cludes the ability to incorporate new technologies, respond to user feedback, and
    adapt to changing market conditions. Too much stability can lead to stagnation, while
    too much flexibility can create chaos and make the platform difficult to use and de­
    velop for. The tension, therefore, is to strike a balance between predictability and
    change, between a solid foundation and the ability to adapt.
    This paradox manifests itself in different ways. For example, platform owners
    need to maintain stable APIs so that developers’ applications continue to work as the
    platform evolves. However, these same APIs might need to be updated or even re­
    placed to support new features and technologies. Every time OpenAI or Anthropic up­
    date the capabilities of their Large Language Models, scores of developers have to up­
    date their code. The challenge is to make changes to the platform without disrupting
    the work of the ecosystem, or the user experience. This is a key aspect of digital plat­
    form evolution, where changes can have far-reaching consequences for all users and
    stakeholders. Furthermore, a stable platform attracts developers by providing a pre­
    dictable environment for innovation, while a flexible platform ensures that the plat­
    form remains competitive and relevant in a fast-paced digital world. This inherent du­
    ality requires a dynamic balancing act where platform owners are constantly
    adapting their strategy to maintain a balance between stability and flexibility.
    Stability Versus Flexibility 139
    Real-World Example: Google’s Android Fragmentation
    The Android operating system provides an example of the challenges associated with
    managing the stability-flexibility tension in a real-world setting. Android’s open na­
    ture allows for significant customization by device manufacturers, which promotes
    flexibility and innovation. However, this flexibility also leads to a fragmented ecosys­
    tem, with different versions of the operating system running on different devices,
    causing significant challenges for developers, and often a suboptimal experience for
    end users. This fragmentation makes it difficult for developers to target all Android
    users effectively, as their apps may behave differently on various devices and ver­
    sions of the operating system. The need to test across multiple Android versions often
    creates additional costs for developers which impacts innovation. In a sense, the high
    degree of flexibility in the Android ecosystem created a lack of platform stability,
    making it a challenge to provide a seamless user experience, which impacted nega­
    tively on the platform’s potential and value capture. This highlights the inherent chal­
    lenges of managing a platform ecosystem where flexibility and stability are at odds
    with each other.
    The tension between stability and flexibility on the Android platform is evident
    in Google’s attempts to address the fragmentation issue. While Google encourages in­
    novation and customization, they have also implemented measures to ensure a mini­
    mum level of consistency across the ecosystem. For example, Google has introduced
    compatibility requirements for devices to run Google’s suite of apps. This was in­
    tended to create a core level of stability, while still allowing device manufacturers a
    degree of freedom to innovate. These efforts show that even with the advantages of
    an open and flexible platform, there is a need to maintain a certain level of stability
    to guarantee a smooth, consistent, user experience, and to enable a thriving developer
    ecosystem. The ongoing need to balance these conflicting needs shows that this is a
    constant challenge for the platform owners.
    Potential Remedies: Modular Design and Versioning
    One way to navigate the stability-flexibility tension is through modular design, where
    the platform is built using independent, interchangeable modules (Pil & Cohen, 2006).
    This approach allows platform owners to update specific parts of the platform with­
    out affecting other parts of the system. For example, new features can be introduced
    as separate modules which can be integrated into the platform without requiring ex­
    tensive changes in the core. This minimizes the risk of disruption from changes while
    allowing for incremental improvements and innovation. The modular design ap­
    proach, therefore, promotes flexibility by enabling change to be introduced without
    compromising the overall stability of the platform.
    140 Chapter 9 Generativity in Practice: The Trade-offs and Challenges of Generativity
    Another strategy is to implement version control mechanisms, providing different
    versions of the platform for different use-cases or user segments. This allows for new
    features and technologies to be tested in controlled environments before being rolled
    out to the entire ecosystem. It also allows platform owners to support legacy applica­
    tions while gradually migrating to new versions of the platform. Versioning, there­
    fore, can be used as a way to provide both flexibility and stability at the same time.
    Variety Versus Utility
    As platforms embrace generativity, they often face a critical tension between the vari­
    ety of complements offered and the utility that those complements provide to users
    (Cennamo & Santaló, 2019). While a greater variety of complements can attract a
    wider user base by catering to diverse needs and preferences, not all complements
    are created equal. Some may be of low quality, poorly designed, or simply not very
    useful, thus diminishing the overall value proposition of the platform. The core chal­
    lenge, then, is that while generativity can lead to greater variety, it does not automati­
    cally guarantee that such variety will be high in utility. This is especially true in the
    case of “experiential” goods, such as software applications or games, where the user
    needs to consume the complement to determine its true value. Therefore, the plat­
    form owner must find ways to incentivize the creation of high-utility complements
    while also fostering a diverse ecosystem. Moreover, an increase in variety can also
    lead to a greater variance in user satisfaction with complements, making the overall
    platform experience less predictable and potentially damaging to the platform’s repu­
    tation. This is because, as more complements are created, it becomes more difficult
    for users to find high-quality options, and some users may have negative experiences
    that color their perception of the platform as a whole.
    This tension is not merely a theoretical concern. It has very practical implications
    for platform owners and complementors. When user satisfaction is a critical driver
    for platform adoption and usage, the presence of low-quality complements can under­
    mine the entire ecosystem. This creates a free-rider problem, where some comple­
    mentors benefit from the overall reputation of the platform without investing in the
    quality of their own offerings. As the platform matures, this problem may become
    more pronounced, as the initial positive spillover effect of generativity is outweighed
    by the negative free-rider effect. This can reduce the incentives for complementors to
    invest in innovation, thus diminishing the overall value of the platform (Cennamo &
    Santaló, 2019). Therefore, platform owners need to consider how their approach to
    generativity will evolve over time, especially as the platform matures, and address
    this variety-utility tension.
    Variety Versus Utility 141
    Real-World Example: Video Game Consoles
    The video game console market provides a compelling example of the variety-utility
    tension (Cennamo & Santaló, 2019). In the early stages of a console’s lifecycle, greater
    generativity, as measured by the introduction of new game types, positively affects
    user satisfaction with games. This is because new games, especially in new genres,
    provide a wider range of experiences, which attract a diverse base of users. However,
    as the console matures and the number of available games increases, the positive ef­
    fect of generativity on user satisfaction diminishes and eventually turns negative.
    This is because, with greater generativity and variety, there is also a higher chance of
    free-riding and lower-quality games being released. As more games enter the market­
    place, users’ average satisfaction declines because there is also a greater variance in
    quality and the abundance of options makes it harder to find the best titles. Thus,
    while the increase in the number of games can appeal to a wider audience, the games
    that are introduced later in a console’s lifecycle are associated with declining average
    user satisfaction.
    Potential Remedies: Balancing Variety and Utility
    To address the variety-utility tension, platform owners can implement a variety of
    strategies that seek to balance the two. First, rather than maximizing variety per se,
    they should aim for quality variety. This means implementing more robust screening
    mechanisms to filter out low-quality complements and creating a more curated expe­
    rience. These mechanisms can involve setting minimum quality standards for inclu­
    sion in the platform, providing support and resources to developers to help them im­
    prove their products, and even offering direct marketing support to complementors.
    Additionally, the platform owner can also offer incentives for complementors to pro­
    duce high-quality content. This can be achieved through a combination of direct fi­
    nancial incentives, reduced royalty fees, or higher placement in the discovery mecha­
    nisms. The platform owner can also make it easier for consumers to identify and find
    high-quality complements through its promotion and curation privileges, by imple­
    menting recommendation systems, user review systems, and curated lists of “best”
    complements.
    Another approach is to focus on the platform’s architecture and design to pro­
    mote complements that provide specific types of utility. For example, a platform
    owner might design APIs and SDKs that make it easier to create certain types of com­
    plements (Ghazawneh & Henfridsson, 2013). This approach can guide the ecosystem
    towards certain areas of innovation. However, they must also allow for flexibility for
    complementors to innovate in unexpected ways. For example, a platform may have a
    developer program that encourages a particular kind of application but still allows
    others to participate in the ecosystem.
    142 Chapter 9 Generativity in Practice: The Trade-offs and Challenges of Generativity
    Finally, it is important to understand that the variety-utility tension can change
    as the platform matures. Platform owners must evolve their governance mechanisms
    over time, adapting to the changing dynamics of the ecosystem. This may involve
    shifting from a more open approach in the early stages of the platform’s lifecycle to a
    more curated approach as the platform matures. Ultimately, the key is to find a bal­
    ance that allows for both variety and utility, ensuring that the platform ecosystem re­
    mains vibrant and valuable for all participants.
    Originality Versus Remixing
    The tension between originality and remixing arises from the inherent nature of digital
    platforms as spaces for both collaboration and creation (Hill & Monroy-Hernández,
    2013). While generativity often involves the remixing and re-appropriation of existing
    content (Lessig, 2009), this process can sometimes hinder the emergence of truly origi­
    nal works. The ease with which content can be copied, modified, and redistributed can
    inadvertently lead to superficial adaptations rather than genuine creative transforma­
    tions. Given that remix culture can be very conducive to generativity, platform designs
    must carefully balance the generative potential of remixing with the need to foster orig­
    inal contributions that push the boundaries of creative expression.
    This tension is further complicated by the fact that certain features that promote
    the generativity of a work also tend to decrease the originality of the resulting re­
    mixes (Hill & Monroy-Hernández, 2013). For example, works created by prominent au­
    thors tend to be remixed more often, but these remixes often maintain a high degree
    of recognizability with the original, limiting the originality of the derivative work.
    Similarly, works that are already remixes themselves are more likely to be remixed
    further, but these subsequent remixes tend to be less original, becoming increasingly
    refined rather than transformative. Recent debates around AI art illustrate this phe­
    nomenon: many artists refuse to even recognize AI-generated images as art, and con­
    sider resemblance to the work of real artists to be a form of theft (Goetze, 2024). This
    highlights the complexity of managing a platform’s creative ecosystem as features
    and designs that promote increased user engagement through remixing may come at
    the cost of diminished originality and lead to superficial content.
    Real-World Example: The Scratch Online Community
    The Scratch Online Community, a platform where young people create and share in­
    teractive animations and games, provides a concrete illustration of this tension (Hill &
    Monroy-Hernández, 2013). In this community, remixing is explicitly encouraged, with
    every project licensed under Creative Commons, allowing for reuse, and the platform
    features prominent download buttons for easy access. The platform also features
    Ecosystem Boundaries Versus Product Boundaries 143
    ways for users to communicate with each other, as well as “love” projects which pro­
    mote creator visibility. Despite this encouragement, the data from Scratch shows that
    only a small portion of projects are ever remixed, and issues of originality often
    emerge. Users react negatively to visibly similar remixes and accuse others of a lack
    of originality. Hill and Monroy-Hernandez (2013) found that while moderate complex­
    ity, creator prominence, and cumulativeness increased generativity in Scratch, these
    very qualities were associated with decreased originality in the resulting remixes.
    These dynamics highlight the challenges that platform designers face when trying to
    encourage both remixing and originality.
    Potential Remedies: Balancing Generativity and Originality
    Addressing the tension between originality and remixing requires a multi-faceted ap­
    proach that goes beyond simply encouraging user contributions. First, it is necessary
    for designers to recognize the impact of their design choices on the creative output of
    their users. For instance, platform features should not overemphasize or reward the
    mere act of remixing, which can unintentionally incentivize superficial adaptations
    over original work. Platform designers should aim to provide an environment that
    encourages more transformative remixing. This approach may include offering tools
    and features that enable users to go beyond the mere copying of existing content and
    create novel outputs with unique value.
    Second, it is important to promote the visibility of new original content alongside
    remixes to provide a more balanced ecosystem. Platforms can highlight original
    works through dedicated sections or reward systems, ensuring that they are not
    drowned out by the sheer volume of remixes. It is important to support and promote
    the authors of original works and make them visible in the community. Moreover,
    platforms might consider mechanisms for recognizing and rewarding originality,
    such as badges, rankings, or other forms of recognition that encourage users to create
    novel content. These methods can counter the bias towards remixing by emphasizing
    and rewarding unique creations. Additionally, education about copyright and creative
    contributions could help users understand the difference between a transformative
    remix and mere copying, which might address negative user reactions.
    Ecosystem Boundaries Versus Product Boundaries
    The generativity advantage is about being able to benefit from the innovations of
    others outside your firm. But your firm is likely in a position of privileged access to
    the platform, in such a way that it would be a market leader if it pursued some inno­
    vations with the platform on its own. So the question becomes: which innovations to
    pursue internally and which innovations to leave to the external ecosystem?
    144 Chapter 9 Generativity in Practice: The Trade-offs and Challenges of Generativity
    The expansion of ecosystem boundaries and the expansion of product boundaries
    represent two distinct yet interconnected pathways for platform growth and evolu­
    tion. The expansion of ecosystem boundaries refers to the broadening of the network
    of actors participating in a platform, including complementors, developers, and users.
    This expansion involves increasing the diversity of participants, their skills, and their
    motivations for engaging with the platform. In contrast, the expansion of product
    boundaries pertains to increasing the variety of content, services, and functions of­
    fered on a platform, reflecting the technological and functional evolution of the plat­
    form itself (Fürstenau et al., 2023).
    This tension is complicated by both synergistic and adversarial relationships be­
    tween these forms of expansion. On the synergistic side, expanding product bound­
    aries by adding new features and capabilities often attracts new users who may be­
    come complementors themselves. These new complementors can then leverage the
    expanded product capabilities to create even more innovative solutions, creating a
    virtuous cycle of growth. For instance, when a platform adds new API capabilities, it
    not only enhances the product’s functionality but potentially attracts developers spe­
    cializing in those capabilities, who then create innovations that draw more users to
    the platform.
    However, these two forms of expansion do not always reinforce each other line­
    arly. While a larger ecosystem can provide more diverse ideas and contributions, the
    social interactions required for that collaboration may not directly translate into new
    product features if there is no process for those ideas to be incorporated. Further­
    more, the pursuit of expanding product boundaries by introducing new categories of
    content or services can sometimes dilute the focus of the platform, making it more
    difficult for new complementors to identify their niche or contribution, potentially
    creating a “too much choice” problem for users (Cennamo & Santaló, 2019; Fürstenau
    et al., 2023).
    A particularly challenging aspect emerges when platforms expand their product
    boundaries in ways that directly compete with ecosystem innovations. This creates
    significant uncertainty for complementors, who must weigh the risk of their innova­
    tions potentially becoming core platform features against their investment in develop­
    ment. When platforms absorb successful ecosystem innovations into their core prod­
    uct, it can effectively eliminate entire categories of complementary businesses, and
    the looming threat of such a thing can deter complementary innovators in the first
    place.
    Real-World Example: LLM Platforms
    Large Language Model (LLM) providers like OpenAI offer a compelling example of
    the tension between ecosystem and product boundary expansion. These platforms ini­
    tially focused on providing access to powerful LLMs through APIs, enabling a broad
    Ecosystem Boundaries Versus Product Boundaries 145
    ecosystem of developers to build applications and services. This strategy prioritizes
    the expansion of the ecosystem, empowering third-party developers to generate di­
    verse use cases and applications.
    However, as the platforms evolve, a tension emerges between the initial focus on
    ecosystem growth and the desire to expand product boundaries. OpenAI, for example,
    has introduced numerous features such as custom GPTs, multi-modality (the ability to
    process different types of data like text and images), “canvas” (a document-editing
    workspace), “code interpreter” (which allows the LLM to execute code), web search
    (allowing the LLM to search the internet), and Deep Research (allowing reasoning
    LLMs to search deep in the internet and compile detailed reports). All of these are
    efforts to expand the platform’s product boundary. Each new feature creates opportu­
    nities for innovative applications, potentially attracting new users who might become
    complementors themselves. For instance, the addition of image processing capabili­
    ties has drawn in developers specializing in visual AI applications, expanding both
    the ecosystem and the range of possible innovations.
    Yet this same product expansion can create uncertainty for existing complemen­
    tors, who face uncertainty around whether or not their product is going to become
    “just another feature” on ChatGPT. When OpenAI introduced custom GPTs with the
    ability to process specific document types or execute specialized tasks, it effectively
    reduced the value and posed a competitive threat to many third-party “LLM wrapper”
    applications built on its API (Stokel-Walker, 2023). This expansion of product bound­
    aries, while beneficial to some platform users, might not align perfectly with the
    needs of all developers in the ecosystem, and can also add complexity to the core plat­
    form, increasing the learning curve for developers and potentially detracting from
    the initial goal of ease of use that made the platform attractive to them in the first
    place. There is a risk that a platform owner could over-extend the core product, lead­
    ing to a “feature bloat” that detracts from its original purpose while simultaneously
    undermining the business models of ecosystem participants who had invested in
    building similar functionalities.
    Potential Remedies: Aligning Ecosystem and Product Expansion
    To effectively manage the tension between ecosystem and product boundary expan­
    sion, platform designers need to adopt a more integrative and dynamic approach.
    First, it is crucial to establish clear feedback loops between the ecosystem and the
    product development processes. This can involve creating mechanisms for the plat­
    form’s community to directly contribute to decisions about the platform’s features
    and functionality. For instance, platforms can use open forums, surveys, or co-
    creation events to gather insights from the community about their needs and prefer­
    ences. These insights can then be used to guide the expansion of the product’s fea­
    tures, ensuring that it aligns with the needs of the ecosystem.
    146 Chapter 9 Generativity in Practice: The Trade-offs and Challenges of Generativity
    Platforms might also consider establishing a formal system for complementors to
    propose new platform components or features (Fürstenau et al., 2023). This could in­
    clude a standardized process for submitting, evaluating, and implementing new ideas,
    fostering an environment of collaborative growth. Transparent product roadmaps
    can be provided to allow the ecosystem to better anticipate changes in product bound­
    aries. However, in a highly competitive market, releasing too much information about
    future plans may not be the right strategic move.
    A crucial consideration is how to handle situations where platform evolution
    might compete with ecosystem innovations. Some platforms address this through
    clear policies about which areas they consider “core” versus open for ecosystem inno­
    vation, or by establishing fair compensation or acquisition strategies when absorbing
    successful ecosystem innovations. For example, Salesforce often acquires successful
    ecosystem companies rather than simply replicating their functionality, creating posi­
    tive exit opportunities for complementors while maintaining ecosystem trust.
    Openness Versus Value Capture
    The tension between openness and value capture is a critical challenge for platform
    ecosystems, and it manifests uniquely in the context of open-source platforms like
    WordPress (Um et al., 2013). In essence, this tension highlights the inherent conflict
    between maximizing the accessibility and collaborative potential of a platform (open­
    ness) and ensuring that the platform and its key stakeholders can derive sufficient
    economic benefits from the ecosystem they have created (value capture). Openness,
    in this context, is characterized by the free availability of the platform’s core code,
    which allows anyone to build on, modify, and redistribute it. This fosters a rich eco­
    system where third-party developers contribute to the platform’s functionality, en­
    hancing its overall value and appeal. However, this inherent openness makes direct
    value capture from the core platform challenging, since the core platform is essen­
    tially free. As a result, platform owners and ecosystem participants must find indirect
    mechanisms for value capture, such as complementary services, premium plugins, or
    data-driven insights. The challenge is in ensuring that value capture mechanisms
    align with, and do not undermine, the open and collaborative nature of the platform
    that is the source of its value in the first place.
    The tension between openness and value capture, therefore, is about how to cre­
    ate a business model that is both sustainable and promotes, or at least does not hin­
    der, the collaborative nature of the open platform. This involves balancing the need
    to monetize the platform with the need to maintain the level of openness that fuels
    the platform’s ecosystem and network effects.
    Openness Versus Value Capture 147
    Real-World Example: The WordPress Ecosystem
    The WordPress ecosystem exemplifies the complex interplay of openness and value
    capture. WordPress.org is an open-source platform, and its core software is freely
    available to all. This openness has enabled a vibrant community of third-party devel­
    opers to create over 22,000 plugins, vastly extending the platform’s functionality (Um
    et al., 2013). However, this has also created a complex dynamic where the platform
    owners do not directly capture value from the core platform but instead rely on indi­
    rect mechanisms, including commercial offerings through WordPress.com, as well as
    various forms of value capture by third party plugin developers. For example, some
    developers offer free plugins and other paid premium versions of the same plugins
    that provide additional features. In addition, the open nature of WordPress has led to
    the emergence of a large number of vendors offering complementary services like
    premium themes, website hosting, and other forms of platform support. The core plat­
    form’s openness enables all of these vendors to grow by leveraging the WordPress
    platform’s vast popularity and user base. Although WordPress is an open platform,
    the platform owners exercise extensive control over the evolution of the ecosystem
    through their APIs. In turn, the third-party developers utilize both the platform’s in­
    ternal and external APIs to extend its functionality. This highlights how the inherent
    openness of the core WordPress platform is both a value driver and a source of ten­
    sion in the ecosystem. This tension exists because the core platform is open, and yet
    the various actors in the system are attempting to capture value through various indi­
    rect channels. This tension, however, is fundamental to the generativity of the plat­
    form and the diverse ecosystem that surrounds it.
    Potential Remedies: Balancing Openness and Value Capture
    Addressing the tension between openness and value capture requires a multifaceted
    approach. One potential remedy is to focus on creating and controlling critical resour­
    ces or “control points” within the ecosystem (Bohnsack et al., 2024; Eaton et al., 2010).
    In the WordPress ecosystem, these control points can include the core APIs, documen­
    tation, or community forums. By maintaining some control over these resources, the
    platform owners can influence the direction of innovation, encourage positive contri­
    butions, and ensure a degree of quality and consistency. This approach balances the
    desire for value capture with the platform’s generative potential. Furthermore, plat­
    form owners can adopt a strategy of “curation and promotion” to incentivize and re­
    ward high-quality contributions, while also addressing potential ecosystem gaps. This
    approach not only promotes valuable additions but also helps the platform maintain
    trust and avoid biases in curation that could undermine the overall ecosystem. This
    can involve promoting high-quality, innovative content transparently, while also bal­
    ancing exclusivity with inclusivity.
    148 Chapter 9 Generativity in Practice: The Trade-offs and Challenges of Generativity
    Another important aspect of managing this tension is to recognize and leverage
    the data advantage that can be gained from the platform’s activity (Komljenovic,
    2021). The platform can collect valuable insights from user interactions and plugin
    usage, which can then be used to provide valuable feedback to the ecosystem partici­
    pants, while also improving the platform itself. This data advantage can create a virtu­
    ous cycle, where data-driven insights fuel innovation and encourage participation.
    However, it is equally important to balance data capture with privacy and ensure that
    data is used in a way that does not undermine user trust or the generativity of the
    platform. For instance, the platform could share aggregated data to enhance the user
    experience, while also protecting the individual privacy of its users. In the case of
    WordPress, this might involve sharing information about how plugins are used, while
    also ensuring that individual user data is not exposed. By carefully managing data
    flows and usage, platform owners can align value capture with generative capabilities
    of the platform.
    Conclusion: Embracing the Paradoxes of Generativity
    The tensions we’ve explored in this chapter can be viewed as challenges to be man­
    aged but also barriers to competition and strategic opportunities to be embraced. Like
    a tightrope walker maintaining dynamic balance, successful platforms continuously
    adjust their position across multiple dimensions of tension.
    What makes these tensions particularly fascinating is how they emerge naturally
    from the very qualities that make generativity powerful. The openness that enables
    distributed innovation creates control challenges. The flexibility that allows platforms
    to evolve can undermine their stability. The variety that attracts diverse users can di­
    lute quality. These aren’t bugs in the system—they’re essential features of generative
    environments.
    The examples we’ve examined—from Apple’s evolving app store policies to
    WordPress’s open ecosystem, from Android’s fragmentation challenges to OpenAI’s
    expansion dilemmas—reveal that even the most successful platforms grapple with
    these tensions continuously. Their success lies in developing sophisticated mecha­
    nisms for dynamic adjustment and patient evolution.
    Several key principles emerge from our analysis:
87. Embrace Opportunities: Rather than viewing tensions as problems to solve, see
    them as spaces where innovative solutions can emerge. This means developing
    governance structures that can harness opposing forces productively.
88. Practice Strategic Patience: Particularly around monetization and value cap­
    ture, resist the urge to optimize too early. Build trust and ecosystem health before
    implementing more robust revenue models.
    Conclusion: Embracing the Paradoxes of Generativity 149
89. Employ Data-Driven Adaptation: Use metrics and analytics to understand eco­
    system health and guide adjustments. This empirical foundation helps platforms
    make more informed trade-offs.
90. Layer Your Approach: Use multiple complementary mechanisms to address
    each tension. For example, combining technical boundary resources with social
    governance systems to manage the control-generativity balance.
91. Enable Discovery: Rather than rigidly maintaining a predefined value proposi­
    tion, create conditions where new forms of value can emerge from user innova­
    tions. Let the platform’s vision evolve in dialogue with its community’s discov­
    eries.
    Perhaps most importantly, platform owners must recognize that these tensions will
    evolve as their platforms mature. What works in the early stages of platform develop­
    ment may need significant adjustment as the ecosystem grows and becomes more
    complex.
    The rewards for those who master these challenges are transformative. By creat­
    ing environments that enable and channel distributed innovation while maintaining
    platform integrity, organizations can tap into creative potential far beyond their own
    boundaries. The generativity advantage offers firms the ability to scale innovation be­
    yond traditional limits, co-create value with diverse stakeholders, and shape the fu­
    ture of their industries.
    Chapter 10
    Celebrating the Shared Potential of Humanity
    Generative products and marketplaces, at their core, are celebrations of possibility—
    an invitation for humanity’s collective ingenuity to transform uncertainty into oppor­
    tunity. A generative system is a catalyst, not a conclusion. It is designed to invite and
    amplify the creativity of others, opening spaces where solutions and possibilities mul­
    tiply. Designing for generativity is about building platforms where new grammars of
    innovation emerge—languages of creativity that empower users to express and solve
    in ways the original creators could never have imagined.
    No-code platforms like Bubble and Zapier illustrate this principle powerfully.
    Bubble enables users without coding expertise to build fully functional web applica­
    tions, while Zapier allows non-technical users to automate workflows by connecting
    various tools. Many users who experienced these platforms for the first time had a
    sudden sense of delight and empowerment, like they were given new tools and lan­
    guages they never had before, that allowed them to build things they could never
    build before. These platforms do not merely solve problems; they create environ­
    ments where users can invent new solutions, often exceeding the vision of the plat­
    form’s creators. They provide the scaffolding for creativity and innovation, allowing
    individuals and small teams to scale their ideas without needing vast technical re­
    sources.
    More recently, LLMs and platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s
    Claude have created this sense of delight and empowerment once again among mil­
    lions of user-innovators. You must have felt it, too, the first time you use an LLM plat­
    form like ChatGPT: a sense of magic and the opening of entire new worlds of possibili­
    ties. These platforms have enabled a new wave of applications, from personalized
    assistants to creative tools for writers and educators. The generativity of these plat­
    forms lies in their ability to adapt to countless scenarios, driven by user creativity
    and problem-solving.
    I have personally felt the magic of Generative AI several times since the populari­
    zation of LLMs in 2023. Most recently, the ability to build my own game app (called
    “Match Beat”) and offer it on the Google play store using a combination of Claude,
    Cursor, and Replit made me feel like I could do things I never thought I could. I then
    pushed myself to build a full-fledged Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) list curation plat­
    form that I’ve always wanted to build. Using Replit’s AI agent and assistant tools for
    hundreds of hours, I was able to build Lstr.cc, one of the world’s most comprehensive
    list curation platforms, with AI features galore! For many years I thought I would
    have to recruit a team of software developers to build this, but now I was able to do it
    myself. I now teach my students to use AI coding or “vibe coding” tools in similar
    ways, and encourage them to completely rethink their capability sets.

    Embracing the Unknowable 151
    The generativity advantage is not just valuable for the business leaders who pur­
    sue it; it is valuable precisely because it empowers others to create and capture value
    of their own. In building generative platforms, leaders craft the foundations for a new
    grammar of progress—one that embraces unpredictability and prizes the contribu­
    tions of many over the control of the few.
    Generativity operates as a compounding force, hence the “generativity flywheel,”
    where each turn accelerates the next. Each innovation begets more innovation, each
    discovery catalyzes new possibilities. These cycles of creativity not only sustain mo­
    mentum but also amplify the range and depth of what is achievable. Generativity
    feeds itself, not through central planning but through distributed ingenuity.
    LLMs provide a particularly striking example of the generativity flywheel in ac­
    tion. The release of GPT-4 and Claude, coupled with APIs and development tools, cre­
    ated an explosion of possibilities that continues to accelerate. Each innovative applica­
    tion—whether it’s an AI writing assistant, a coding companion, or a specialized
    research tool—demonstrates new possibilities that inspire others to imagine and
    build. Custom GPTs and AI agents built on these platforms spawn entire new catego­
    ries of applications, which in turn suggest new ways to leverage the underlying tech­
    nology. Developer platforms like Replit, Vercel, and Cursor combine LLMs with other
    tools to create even richer possibility spaces. The profit potential attracts serious en­
    trepreneurs who make sustained investments in building sophisticated applications,
    while marketplace mechanisms help these innovators capture value from their crea­
    tions. This virtuous cycle has turned LLMs from powerful but abstract technologies
    into engines of practical innovation, spawning thousands of applications that their
    creators could never have envisioned.
    Embracing the Unknowable
    Generative systems are rooted in the embrace of uncertainty. They thrive not by dic­
    tating outcomes but by cultivating the conditions for serendipity. These systems reject
    the notion that every innovation can or should be planned. Instead, they create
    frameworks where the unexpected can flourish, where solutions to problems yet un­
    known can emerge from the creativity of others.
    Platforms like Zapier have flourished because they embrace this principle. Zap­
    ier’s simplicity and adaptability allow users to connect applications in novel ways, au­
    tomating tasks that were previously time-consuming or impossible. Each unexpected
    connection made by users expands the platform’s value, revealing possibilities the
    original developers never envisioned. Similarly, OpenAI’s API ecosystem thrives on
    the unknown. Developers are using it to create tools for niche markets, from health­
    care diagnostics to legal document automation—solutions that emerged not from
    OpenAI’s vision but from the imagination of its users.
    152 Chapter 10 Celebrating the Shared Potential of Humanity
    The generativity advantage requires leaders to relinquish the illusion of complete
    control. It asks them to accept that the most transformative uses of their systems may
    arise from directions they never anticipated. By embracing the unknowable, busi­
    nesses can transcend traditional limits and enable the kind of innovation that de­
    fines eras.
    Pursuing generativity is not for the timid. It demands a deliberate choice to prior­
    itize openness and long-term value over short-term gains and rigid control. It involves
    navigating trade-offs between enabling innovation and maintaining strategic coher­
    ence. For platforms like no-code tools and automation systems, this balance is essen­
    tial—supporting creativity without allowing chaos to erode the user experience.
    The leaders of generative systems understand that their role is not to dictate out­
    comes but to design ecosystems that thrive on their own. These ecosystems must be
    robust enough to support distributed innovation while capturing value sustainably.
    The generativity advantage is not about micromanaging every interaction; it is about
    enabling countless contributors to create, explore, and redefine the boundaries of
    what is possible.
    The generativity advantage is not just valuable for the business leaders who pur­
    sue it; it is valuable precisely because it empowers others to create and capture value
    of their own, and that those innovations of others do not need to be predicted in ad­
    vance. It requires patience, humility, and a commitment to fostering environments
    where creativity thrives.
    I wrote in an earlier chapter that generativity “requires the humility to acknowl­
    edge that the most valuable uses of your creation may come from directions you
    never anticipated.” This means that a platform like Bubble would have to be prepared
    for the possibility that one of the apps built on the platform ends up being even more
    profitable than Bubble itself. Someone may discover the “killer” use case for Bubble
    and it may be something that the company itself did not predict. Already, Bubble’s co-
    CEO boasts that internet traffic to Bubble apps is roughly ten times higher than traffic
    to Bubble’s own website.1
    An example of this has recently happened with Anthropic, the maker of one of
    the leading Large Language Models, whose Claude 3.5 Sonnet was the best AI pro­
    grammer for many months, and almost single handedly spawned the AI coding reov­
    lution. While the company has a consumer facing app at Claude.ai that users can use
    for a variety of tasks, Sonnet has found its most demanded use case outside of the
    consumer app, where its services are employed through the API as a software coding
    assistant. Two of the most popular coding assistants are Replit.com and Cursor.com,
    and indications are that users of these platforms are using Claude so much that An­
    thropic is running out of capacity to deliver its services.2 In other words, a single use

    AI Agents and the Future of Generativity 153
    case for Anthropic’s generative product was found by other companies (not An­
    thropic) and is so popular that Anthropic is running out of capacity to satisfy demand.
    When I say that generativity requires the humility to embrace the unknowable I
    mean that a company like Anthropic should be prepared for outcomes like this, and
    should feel no shame in not having been the ones to find the most popular or profit­
    able use case themselves.
    The Anthropic case gives us the opportunity to note once again that applying con­
    ventional approaches to strategy and entrepreneurship may not be the right approach
    for generative products. With the lean startup philosophy of “pivoting” until you find
    “Product-Market Fit” (PMF), a company like Anthropic may decide that since the
    strongest PMF for their product is currently in AI coding, then that means they should
    refocus all their efforts on becoming an AI coding company. For generative products,
    this approach is ill-advised, and would lead to a weakened generativity advantage by
    creating unnecessary focus and locking the company out of a world of unforeseen
    possibilities. A rule of thumb for a generativity strategy is to choose the path that in­
    volves the least need for both prediction and control of other people’s innovations
    around your platform.
    AI Agents and the Future of Generativity
    Generativity points to a future defined by collaborative invention and expanding pos­
    sibilities. The next generation of platforms will not just connect users or distribute
    tools; they will amplify human potential by enabling co-creation on a massive scale.
    These systems hold the promise of democratizing innovation, allowing more voices to
    participate in shaping solutions to global challenges.
    Increasingly, AI agents will play a significant role in this future. LLM-driven
    agents are evolving from passive tools to autonomous contributors within generative
    digital platforms. Research has already demonstrated their capacity to produce good
    ideas (Girotra et al., 2023), and recent advancements have enabled these agents to in­
    corporate memory, specialized knowledge, and autonomous planning capabilities (Su­
    mers et al., 2024). They can already control a mouse and keyboard and will soon be
    able to act like any other innovator in generative ecosystems. Users of Bubble have
    already employed LLMs with computer use capabilities to autonomously build with
    the Bubble platform,3 and Bubble has recently released an AI app builder agent
    as well.
    When LLMs take care of certain intellectual tasks, including ones that involve cre­
    ativity, the role of humans may move to a higher meta-level in the process. But the
    key takeaway for generative platforms at the dawn of the generative AI age is that
    � https://x.com/chris__strobl/status/1882934972409053677
    154 Chapter 10 Celebrating the Shared Potential of Humanity
    they must prepare their platforms not only for humans but also for AI agents. Both
    humans and AIs should be able to interface with the platform, and contribute ideas
    and innovations. All generative platforms need to rethink their product interface to
    allow AI agents to become idea-contributing agents in their user-innovation work­
    flows. If you don’t do it yourself, someone will build the alternative to your platform
    that does it.
    Take for example, the rise of Lindy.ai and similar platforms like Gumloop and
    n8n that are now challenging Zapier. Despite being a very AI-forward company and
    rapidly adding AI features, Zapier was still not allowing AIs to contribute in every
    way so humans could contribute ideas to the design of no-code automations. Lindy.ai
    has essentially re-created the Zapier interface and mechanics, with the key difference
    that for any field that you can enter as a human in Zapier, you can ask an AI to deter­
    mine what to put in that field in Lindy, and you can do so every single time the auto­
    mation flow runs.
    This is a sign of things to come for every software platform out there, and specifi­
    cally for generative platforms: you need to expand the sources of unpredicted ideas to
    include AI agents.
    A Challenge to You
    In closing, I would like to issue a challenge and an invitation to you, the reader. To
    entrepreneurs and leaders: appreciate the value of designing systems that amplify
    possibility by enabling the masses (not just developers) to innovate and profit from
    their innovations. To policymakers and academics: champion frameworks that pro­
    tect and nurture generativity, as it results in patterns of growth that benefit society as
    a whole. To creators and users: look for the products and platforms that not only
    have an extensive range of functionality you can play with but are also made by com­
    panies that take you seriously as an innovator and entrepreneur, and help you profit
    fairly from your innovations. Continue to push the boundaries of these systems and
    expand what they can achieve.
    Generativity is not confined to business applications; it is conducive societal prog­
    ress. By empowering distributed innovation—including the contributions of intelli­
    gent AI agents—generative systems hold the key to unlocking solutions to the world’s
    most pressing problems. They enable us to move beyond incremental change and to­
    ward transformative leaps that redefine industries, economies, and societies.
    The Generativity Advantage is a call to celebrate the shared potential of humanity
    in whatever your next project is. It is based on a timeless truth: the most powerful
    innovations are those that empower others to innovate.
