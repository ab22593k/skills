# Latency Principles

Based on "Latency: Reduce delay in software systems" by Pekka Enberg (Manning, 2026).

This skill provides a systematic framework for minimizing delay in software systems, covering the entire stack from Physics and Hardware to Application Architecture and User Experience.

## Foundational Concepts

- **What is Latency?**: The time delay between a **cause** and its **observed effect**.
- **Latency vs. Bandwidth**: You can always add more bandwidth (more links), but you are stuck with bad latency unless you optimize the path.
- **Impact on User Experience (UX)**: < 100ms (immediate), < 1s (instant), > 10s (slow).
- **Measuring Correctly**: Use **percentiles** (p95, p99) to capture tail latency. Avoid averages. Avoid **Coordinated Omission** by using fixed-interval benchmarking.

## Modeling Performance

Use these laws to establish theoretical bounds and size systems:

- **Little's Law**: `Concurrency (C) = Throughput (T) * Latency (L)`
    - *Usage*: Calculate required concurrency to support a target throughput at a given latency.
    - *Example*: If p99 latency is 50ms and you need 1000 RPS, you need `1000 * 0.05 = 50` concurrent execution units.
- **Amdahl's Law**: `Speedup = 1 / ((1 - P) + (P / N))`
    - `P`: Portion of program that is parallelizable.
    - `N`: Number of processors.
    - *Usage*: Understand the limits of parallelization. If 50% of your code is serial, the max speedup is 2x, regardless of how many cores you add.

## Measurement & Visualization

Visualizing latency distributions is critical for identifying tail behavior:

1.  **Histograms**: Show frequency of samples. Good for seeing the "mode" (most common latency) and the spread.
2.  **HDR Histograms**: Plot latency against percentiles (p50, p99, etc.) on a log scale. Essential for p99.9+ analysis.
3.  **eCDF (Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function)**: A smooth curve showing the probability that a request completes within a given time. Directly answers SLA compliance questions.

**Tooling**:
- Use `scripts/ping_collector.py` to gather data without Coordinated Omission.
- Use `scripts/visualize_latency.py` to generate Histogram, HDR, and eCDF plots.

## Quick Decision Guide

| Symptom | Probable Cause | Recommended Strategy |
|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| **High Avg Latency** | Sequential processing / Slow I/O | **Concurrency** (Async I/O) or **Partitioning** |
| **High Tail Latency (p99)** | Lock contention / GC / Neighbor noise | **Wait-free Sync** (Atomics) or **Request Hedging** |
| **Network Slowness** | Distance / Protocol overhead | **Colocation** (Edge) or **Binary Serialization** (Protobuf) |
| **Database Load** | Hot keys / Complex queries | **Caching** (Read-through) or **Materialized Views** |
| **Slow Writes** | ACID guarantees / Indexing | **Write-Behind Caching** or **Sharding** |
| **High CPU Usage** | O(n^2) logic / JSON parsing | **Algorithmic Fixes** or **Protobuf/FlatBuffers** |
| **Micro-stutters** | GC pauses / OS interrupts | **Object Pooling** or **Interrupt Affinity** |
| **Lock Contention** | Mutex bottleneck | **Wait-free Sync** (Atomics) |
| **"It feels slow"** | UI blocking on network | **Optimistic Updates** or **Prefetching** |
| **Measurement Looks Too Good** | Coordinated Omission | **Fixed-Interval Benchmarking** |

## Part 2: Data Layer (Access Optimization)

Optimizing data access is often the highest-leverage activity for reducing latency.

- **Colocation (Pattern: Move Compute to Data)**:
    - **Edge Computing**: Use Near Edge (points of presence) or Far Edge (on-device/IoT) to eliminate geographical distance.
    - **Intranode**: Colocate protocol handlers with application threads. Turn off **Nagle's Algorithm** (`TCP_NODELAY`) to prevent packet batching delays.
    - **Kernel-bypass**: Use techniques like DPDK to eliminate OS stack overhead.
- **Replication (Pattern: Trade Consistency for Latency)**:
    - **Leaderless/Multi-Leader**: Allows local writes to reduce write latency, at the cost of complex conflict resolution.
    - **Consistency Models**: Choose **Eventual Consistency** or **Read-your-writes** to avoid synchronous coordination (Strong Consistency) overhead.
- **Partitioning (Pattern: Divide and Conquer)**:
    - **Horizontal Sharding**: Splitting data to increase parallel throughput.
    - **Request Routing**: Use **Direct Routing** (client-side) to avoid the extra hop of a proxy.
    - **Mitigate Hot Partitions**: Use over-partitioning to balance skewed workloads.
- **Caching (Pattern: Memory is Faster than Disk)**:
    - **Write-Behind Caching**: Asynchronous writes to the data store to hide write latency.
    - **Policy Selection**: Use **SIEVE** or **LRU** for eviction.
    - **Materialized Views**: Precompute complex queries to eliminate runtime processing work.

See **[references/data_patterns.md](references/data_patterns.md)** for detailed implementation strategies.

## Part 3: Compute Layer (Logic Acceleration)

Optimizing processing logic and synchronization to eliminate overhead.

- **Eliminating Work (Pattern: The Fastest Code is Code that Doesn't Run)**:
    - **Algorithmic Complexity**: Replace O(n) scans with O(log n) trees or O(1) hash maps.
    - **Zero-Copy Serialization**: Use **FlatBuffers** instead of JSON to eliminate the parsing/unpacking step.
    - **Memory Tuning**: Avoid dynamic allocation (`malloc`/`new`) in hot paths. Use **Object Pooling** or **Stack Allocation** to prevent GC pauses or allocator lock contention.
    - **Precomputation**: Move work from runtime to build-time or startup.
- **Wait-Free Sync (Pattern: Avoid Context Switches)**:
    - **Mutual Exclusion Problems**: Locks (Mutexes) cause expensive OS context switches (~µs).
    - **Atomics**: Use hardware primitives (`CAS`, `fetch_add`) for lock-free state updates.
    - **Wait-Free Structures**: Implement **Ring Buffers** (SPSC) using memory barriers to allow threads to communicate without ever blocking.
- **Exploiting Concurrency (Pattern: Use Every Core)**:
    - **Thread-per-core**: Pin threads to physical cores to maximize cache locality and eliminate scheduler overhead.
    - **Concurrency Models**: Use **Coroutines/Fibers** for lightweight userspace multitasking or **Actor Model** for shared-nothing message passing.
    - **SIMD**: Use "Single Instruction, Multiple Data" to parallelize arithmetic at the hardware level.

See **[references/compute_optimization.md](references/compute_optimization.md)** for detailed implementation patterns.

## Part 4: Hiding Latency (Perceived Speed)

When you can't make it faster, make it *feel* faster by masking delays.

- **Asynchronous Processing (Pattern: Don't Block the Main Thread)**:
    - **Request Hedging**: Send the same request to multiple replicas and use the first response to cut **tail latency**.
    - **Request Batching**: Group small requests to amortize round-trip and header overhead.
    - **Backpressure**: Prevents queuing latency by signaling producers to slow down when the system is saturated.
- **Predictive Techniques (Pattern: Guess the Future)**:
    - **Prefetching**: Load data (Sequential, Spatial, or **Semantic** based on user intent) before it's explicitly requested.
    - **Optimistic Updates**: Update the UI immediately assuming success; reconcile or rollback if the server fails.
- **Speculative Execution (Pattern: Execute Before Needed)**:
    - **Parallel Speculation**: Execute multiple possible outcomes in parallel and keep the correct one (e.g., in a search engine).
    - **Prewarming**: Spin up resources (Lambdas, VM instances) based on historical traffic patterns before they are needed.

See **[references/hiding_latency.md](references/hiding_latency.md)** for detailed masking strategies.
