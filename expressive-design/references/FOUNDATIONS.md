## Design Principles

### Principle 1: Emotion Through Design

Expressive design makes users feel something. It inspires emotion, communicates function, and helps users achieve their goals. Every design decision should consider the emotional impact on the user.

### Principle 2: Usability Through Emphasis

Strategic use of color, size, shape, and containment draws attention to key elements, helping users navigate more quickly and efficiently. Expressive design enhances rather than compromises usability.

### Principle 3: Inclusivity

M3 Expressive designs are more accessible to users of all ages and abilities. The emphasis on larger touch targets, high-contrast containment, and clear visual hierarchy creates interfaces that work better for everyone.

### Principle 4: Balance

Expressive design requires balancing freshness with familiarity. Too much novelty can confuse users, while too little fails to engage. The M3 Expressive system provides guidance for finding this balance.

## Communication Principles

### Principle 5: Explain Consequences

When users face consequential actions, communicate outcomes in neutral, direct language.

**Do:**
- State what will happen: "This will delete 12 items from your library"
- Provide undo information: "You can restore items from trash within 30 days"
- Use plain, factual descriptions

**Don't:**
- Use alarming warnings: "Warning: This action is irreversible!"
- Sound condescending: "Are you sure you want to proceed?"
- Misrepresent consequences to influence decisions
- Add unnecessary cautions that intimidate users

The goal is informed consent—users understand the outcome and retain control.

### Principle 6: Use Scannable Words and Formats

Users scan UI text rather than reading it fully. Choose words and formatting that aid rapid comprehension.

**Do:**
- Use specific headings: "Payment methods" instead of "Settings"
- Front-load key words: "Delete account" not "Account deletion options"
- Choose descriptive labels: "Shipping address" not "Address details"
- Use contractions for natural tone: "can't", "don't", "you'll"
- Use commas in numbers 1,000–1,000,000
- Use "M" for millions when showing volume: "2M downloads"
- Use "&" in headers and buttons where space is tight
- Use bold for emphasis instead of italics
- Use italics only for names or titles
- Use ellipses for in-progress actions or incomplete text
- Use parentheses to define acronyms: "API (Application Programming Interface)"
- Omit periods in labels, tooltips, bullets, and single-line text
- Reserve periods for multiple sentences or complex text

**Don't:**
- Use vague headings: "General info", "Details", "Miscellaneous"
- Bury key words mid-sentence
- Choose generic labels that require context to understand
- Spell out contractions: "cannot", "do not", "you will"
- Use commas in identifiers: years, addresses, frequencies
- Use ampersands in body text—spell out "and"
- Use italics for emphasis—hard to read
- Use ellipses in buttons/menu items that open dialogs
- Use parentheses for side notes—if it matters, integrate into sentence
- Add periods to single-line UI elements that break scanning rhythm

Specific words, contractions, and clear number formatting help users find what matters during hurried scanning. Use "do not" only when emphasis is needed.

### Principle 7: Use Abbreviations Sparingly

Abbreviations create barriers for comprehension. Spell out words whenever space allows.

**Do:**
- Write full phrases: "for example" instead of "e.g."
- Use "and more" or "and others" instead of "etc."
- Spell out: "Monday" not "Mon", "January" not "Jan"
- Reserve abbreviations for tight space constraints only

**Don't:**
- Use Latin abbreviations: "e.g.", "i.e.", "etc."
- Abbreviate when space permits the full word
- Create custom abbreviations users won't recognize

Clear, complete words improve comprehension for all users. Use "M" for millions in volume contexts: "2M downloads"

### Principle 8: Address the User Directly

Use second-person pronouns to create personal connection and help users take action. This reinforces M3 Expressive's goal of emotional engagement.

**Do:**
- Write from user's perspective: "Your files" not "User files"
- Use "you/your" consistently throughout a screen
- Use "we" for app-level actions: "We saved your changes"
- Or remove pronouns entirely if consistency can't be maintained

**Don't:**
- Mix first and second person: "Your account" ... "My settings" on same screen
- Use "we/I" for corporate voice: "Google recommends..." instead of "We recommend..."
- Use third person: "The user must...", "Users can..."
- Write impersonally: "File not found" instead of "We couldn't find your file"
- Switch perspectives mid-flow

Consistent, direct address creates emotional connection and helps users understand their relationship to the content. Reserve "we" for app-level feedback, not corporate messaging.

## When to Apply Expressive Design

### Recommended Use Cases

- **Media and entertainment** - Music players, video apps, games
- **Communication** - Email, messaging, social apps
- **Creative tools** - Photo editors, design software
- **Consumer products** - E-commerce, lifestyle apps
- **Entertainment-focused** - Streaming, news with visual content

### Case Study: Email Application

In the email app case study, the **Send** button was made larger, placed just above the keyboard, and used a secondary color to draw attention. Participants could spot the button **four times faster** compared to a standard top app bar placement.

## When to Avoid Expressive Design

### Avoid or Minimize Use

- **Banking and finance** - Security and trust are paramount
- **Healthcare** - Clarity and efficiency over emotion
- **Safety-critical** - Interface must be unambiguous
- **Productivity tools** - Efficiency over engagement
- **Forms and data entry** - Speed and accuracy focus

### Case Study: Playlist Design

A test replacing a familiar vertical song list with scattered album art images resulted in modern and exciting visuals but suffered **decreased usability scores**. Users recognized the traditional pattern more quickly and completed tasks more efficiently.

### Case Study: Email Actions

Removing text labels from email actions resulted in **decreased usability**, demonstrating that basic interaction paradigms should be preserved even in expressive designs.

## Application Guidelines

### Start with User Need

While there is broad appeal for vibrant, expressive design, a significant minority of users prefer calmer, less intense versions. Always start with understanding user requirements and critical journeys.

### Prioritize Functionality

Do not compromise core functionality for visual appeal. No amount of emotion can compensate for lack of clarity or efficiency.

### Iterate and Test

Use research methods to find the right balance. Test designs against established usability metrics and iterate based on user feedback.

### Follow Accessibility Standards

Maintain compliance with color contrast, screen reader compatibility, navigation, and accessibility best practices even while applying expressive elements.

## Implementation Summary

M3 Expressive provides a research-backed system for creating emotionally engaging user experiences. By strategically applying color, shape, size, motion, and containment, designers can create interfaces that are both beautiful and highly usable.

The key is intentional application—using expressive elements where they enhance user experience and maintaining familiar patterns where they support efficiency and clarity.
